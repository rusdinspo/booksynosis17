<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Understanding the Dreams You Dream: Biblical Keys for Hearing God&#39;s Voice in the Night</h2><p><p>God frequently talks through dreams. The Bible reveals that in the past, dreams were the most common way God talked to His people. The people in the Bible communicated with God through prayer, and He answered them in dreams. God does not change, neither has the way He communicates with His children.</p> <p>Unlike the early Christians, today's believers often treat dreams like junk mail. In doing so, they often throw away the very answers they asked for when they prayed for counsel and guidance.</p> <p><i>Understanding the Dreams You Dream</i> is written from a Christian perspective to help Christians understand the symbolic language of dreams. Deliberately written without technical jargon, this book can be easily understand and used by everyone. It is the only complete, one-volume Christian reference book for interpreting dreams on the market today.</p></p><p>For those who have ever had a dream in which they think God was speaking to them, this practical guide, written from the Christian perspective, helps readers understand the symbolic language of dreams.Ira and Judy Milligan founded Servant Ministries, Inc. in 1986.

Most of his work was done at the Max Planck Institute of Behavioral Psychology, in Seewiesen, Bavaria. Lorenz studied greylag geese and jackdaws in particular, and rediscovered the principle of imprinting (originally described by Douglas Spalding in the nineteenth century). In 1973, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing it with two other important ethologists, Niko Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch. His books for lay readers include &#34;King Solomon&#39;s Ring&#34;, &#34;Man Meets Dog&#34;, &#34;Behind the Mirror&#34;, &#34;Civilized Man&#39;s Eight Deadly Sins&#34;, and &#34;The Year of the Greylag Goose&#34;.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance Between Nazi Germany and America&#39;s Most Powerful Corporation</h2><p><b>IBM and the Holocaust</b> is the stunning story of IBM's strategic alliance with Nazi Germany -- beginning in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power and continuing well into World War II. As the Third Reich embarked upon its plan of conquest and genocide, IBM and its subsidiaries helped create enabling technologies, step-by-step, from the identification and cataloging programs of the 1930s to the selections of the 1940s. <br><br>Only after Jews were identified -- a massive and complex task that Hitler wanted done immediately -- could they be targeted for efficient asset confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, enslaved labor, and, ultimately, annihilation. It was a cross-tabulation and organizational challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s no computer existed. <br><br>But IBM's Hollerith punch card technology did exist. Aided by the company's custom-designed and constantly updated Hollerith systems, Hitler was able to automate his persecution of the Jews. Historians have always been amazed at the speed and accuracy with which the Nazis were able to identify and locate European Jewry. Until now, the pieces of this puzzle have never been fully assembled. The fact is, IBM technology was used to organize nearly everything in Germany and then Nazi Europe, from the identification of the Jews in censuses, registrations, and ancestral tracing programs to the running of railroads and organizing of concentration camp slave labor. <br><br>IBM and its German subsidiary custom-designed complex solutions, one by one, anticipating the Reich's needs. They did not merely sell the machines and walk away. Instead, IBM leased these machines for high fees and became the sole source of the billions of punch cards Hitler needed.<br><br><b>IBM and the Holocaust</b> takes you through the carefully crafted corporate collusion with the Third Reich, as well as the structured deniability of oral agreements, undated letters, and the Geneva intermediaries -- all undertaken as the newspapers blazed with accounts of persecution and destruction. <br><br>Just as compelling is the human drama of one of our century's greatest minds, IBM founder Thomas Watson, who cooperated with the Nazis for the sake of profit. <br><br>Only with IBM's technologic assistance was Hitler able to achieve the staggering numbers of the Holocaust. Edwin Black has now uncovered one of the last great mysteries of Germany's war against the Jews -- how did Hitler get the names?</p><p>Was IBM, "The Solutions Company," partly responsible for the Final Solution? That's the question raised by Edwin Black's <i>IBM and the Holocaust</i>, the most controversial book on the subject since Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners</i>. Black, a son of Holocaust survivors, is less tendentiously simplistic than Goldhagen, but his thesis is no less provocative: he argues that IBM founder Thomas Watson deserved the Merit Cross (Germany's second-highest honor) awarded him by Hitler, his second-biggest customer on earth. "IBM, primarily through its German subsidiary, made Hitler's program of Jewish destruction a technologic mission the company pursued with chilling success," writes Black. "IBM had almost single-handedly brought modern warfare into the information age [and] virtually put the 'blitz' in the <i>krieg</i>." <p> The crucial technology was a precursor to the computer, the IBM Hollerith punch card machine, which Black glimpsed on exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, inspiring his five-year, top-secret book project. The Hollerith was used to tabulate and alphabetize census data. Black says the Hollerith and its punch card data ("hole 3 signified homosexual ... hole 8 designated a Jew") was indispensable in rounding up prisoners, keeping the trains fully packed and on time, tallying the deaths, and organizing the entire war effort. Hitler's regime was fantastically, suicidally chaotic; could IBM have been the cause of its sole competence: mass-murdering civilians? Better scholars than I must sift through and appraise Black's mountainous evidence, but clearly the assessment is overdue.</p><p> The moral argument turns on one question: How much did IBM New York know about IBM Germany's work, and when? Black documents a scary game of brinksmanship orchestrated by IBM chief Watson, who walked a fine line between enraging U.S. officials and infuriating Hitler. He shamefully delayed returning the Nazi medal until forced to--and when he did return it, the Nazis almost kicked IBM and its crucial machines out of Germany. (Hitler was prone to self-defeating decisions, as demonstrated in <i>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II</i>.) </p><p> Black has created a must-read work of history. But it's also a fascinating business book examining the colliding influences of personality, morality, and cold strategic calculation. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"Edwin Black has given Holocaust history an extraordinary new dimension. Clearly, the destruction of six million Jewish lives, and countless non-Jews, could not have been possible without IBM's Hollerith machines. Nor could the Third Reich have perfected the roundup of Jews throughout Europe, their deportation to concentration camps, and the statistics that measured their final agonies in the Final Solution without custom-designed IBM equipment. These revelations are troubling enough, but Black has crafted a monumental history that goes beyond such horrific revelations. He has discovered the enormous corruptive power of an international enterprise that saw itself above the laws of man and God." <br> -- Abraham Peck, director of research, American Jewish Historical Society<br><br>"<b>IBM and the Holocaust</b> is a tremendous, timely work. Neglected for more than 50 years, the sordid records disclosing the global conglomerate IBM's collaboration with the Nazi regime, in pursuit of market monopoly, have now been exhumed by Edwin Black. His comprehensive and detailed account shows how the blessings of punch card technology can become a curse to human rights, as it did in enabling the Holocaust." <br> -- Robert Wolfe, former chief National Archives expert for captured German records and Nuremberg documentation<br><br>"In this carefully researched, yet chilling book, Edwin Black relates step-by-step how the corporate and technological zeal of IBM, and its CEO, Thomas J. Watson Sr., contributed to Nazi power and advanced the Holocaust. This book is an awesome warning for the future."<br> -- William Seltzer, author of Population Statistics and the Holocaust, and former director, UN Office of Statistics<br></p><h2>Norwegian Touches: History, Recipes, Folk Arts Notably Norwegian</h2><p>They came by boat, some in 1825 in the smallest vessel ever to cross the Atlantic at the time.

A woman was shot and killed in her bed during a burglary; she was given a funeral and everyone in the village saw her body burned. Then, three days later, she was back in her house as if she'd never been dead at all. But now she's clairvoyant, and can speak to the dead. That's why the long-dead brother of a Lao general has enlisted her to help his brother uncover his remains, which have been lost at the bottom of a river for many years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lao national coroner Dr. Siri Paiboun and his wife, Madame Daeng, are sent along to supervise the&nbsp;excavation. It could be a kind of relaxing vacation for them, maybe, except Siri is obsessed with the pretty&nbsp;undead medium's special abilities, and Madame Daeng might be a little jealous. She doesn't trust the woman for some reason&#x2500;is her hunch right? What is the group really digging for at the bottom of this remote river on the Thai border? What war secrets are being covered up?</p><p>Colin Cotterill is the Dilys Award-winning author of nine books in the Dr. Siri Paiboun series: <i>The Coroner's Lunch</i>, <i>Thirty-Three Teeth</i>, <i>Disco for the Departed</i>, <i>Anarchy and Old Dogs</i>, <i>Curse of the Pogo Stick</i>, <i>The Merry Misogynist</i>, <i>Love Songs from a Shallow Grave</i>, and <i>Slash &amp; Burn</i>, and<i> The Woman Who Wouldn't Die</i>. He lives in Chumphon, Thailand, with his wife and five deranged dogs.Madame Keui was flesh and blood, or so they claimed, although nobody could remember touching that rewarmed flesh, nor seeing her bleed; not even when a second bullet passed through her. Even so, to all intents and purposes, she was alive in October of 1978 when this story takes place. They&#x2019;d see her walk along the ridge to collect her groceries or ride her bicycle off into the forest. Some in the village had even heard her speak. She had become Vietnamese, they said. Her Lao was thick with it like too-large lumps of mutton in a broth. She no longer talked directly to the villagers, but strangers from afar came to seek her out. They&#x2019;d go to her house, a fine wooden structure with expensive Chinese furniture; couples and elderly people and families with children. They&#x2019;d sit with her in the living area visible from the quiet dirt street. And when they left, those strangers would seem elated as if a heavy rock had been removed from their souls. But when the villagers stopped them to ask what had happened there, they were silent. It was as if they&#x2019;d forgotten they were<br> ever with her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And perhaps that was why they called her Keui: Madame Used-To-Be. Because whenever they talked about the beautiful old woman it was in the past tense. &#x2018;There used to be a woman who spoke with many voices.&#x2019; &#x2018;There used to be a woman who seemed to get younger as the months passed.&#x2019; &#x2018;There used to be a woman whose<br> house gave off a warm yellow glow even when there was no hurricane lamp oil to be had at the market.&#x2019; And even though they might have passed her on the<br> street that morning, at the evening meal they&#x2019;d still say, &#x2018;There used to be a woman in our village who . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And perhaps that was because two months earlier<br> they&#x2019;d carried her body to the pyre and watched the<br> flames engulf her.<br><br> Chapter 2<br> <i>The Ninjas From Housing</i><br><br> They lurked in the shadows of the late evening. They&#x2019;d waited out three nights of diamante skies, the streets lit by a billion stars. And, at last, a bank of clouds had<br> rolled in and given them this brief cover. There were five of them, each dressed in navy blue, which was as near as damn it to black. And in the starless navy blue<br> of the Vientiane night they would have been invisible were it not for the battery-powered torches each carried. The beams negated all the preparations of dressing<br> darkly and applying charred cork to their faces. But in the suburbs east of the That Luang monument there was as yet no street lighting and there were any number of potholes in which to step. At eleven p.m. most of the householders were asleep and dreaming of better times. For any times were better than these. Only one or two windows gave off an eerie khaki glow from lamps deep inside and one by one these were extinguished as the men passed. Torch beams as loud as klaxons. Everyone in East That Luang knew something was about to go down and they all knew better than to come to their windows to watch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still a block away from their objective, the leader crouched on one knee and signalled for his men to turn off their lamps. They were immediately plunged<br> into the impenetrable black belly of a giant naga. None of them dared move for fear that the earth all around them might have subsided. Yet, not wanting to be considered<br> cowardly, none of them turned his torch back on. So there they remained. Petrified by the darkness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Give your eyes a few minutes, lads,&#x2019; the leader said in a whisper that seemed to ricochet back and forth through the concrete of the new suburb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those few minutes crawled past but still the men&#x2019;s eyes had not become accustomed to the dark. Even so, their leader stood. They heard the rattle of the large bunch of keys on his belt. They knew it was time to continue the advance on house number 22B742. Butterflies flapped inside them. This would be a moment from which careers were honed. Medals were given for less.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They kept close in single file behind the leader who seemed to have a nose for darkness. Up ahead, their target emerged from the night. The house glowed brazenly. Candles flickered in the two front windows and . . . could that be the scent of a tune? Yes. Music. Some decadent Western rubbish. The comrades inside were asking for trouble. Begging for it. They&#x2019;d get what they deserved this night. The front yard was visible now in the candle glow and the men could see one another&#x2019;s beady eyes. The leader pointed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You and you, around the back,&#x2019; he whispered. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t let any escape. We take every last man, woman and child.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two men ran to the side alley with a crouching gait not unlike that of Groucho Marx. But their flank advance was stymied by the fact that the side gate was locked, or blocked, or perhaps it was just a fence that looked like a gate and was too high to&nbsp; climb. They looked back for advice from their leader but he couldn&#x2019;t see them in the shadows. Believing the rearguard to be in place, he led the rest of his team up the garden path to the front porch. He was no lover of these roomridden, occidental-style accommodations. Give him open spaces any day. He reached the door. He had a duplicate key, of course, for number 22B742 but it served no purpose. The door was ajar. He swallowed a gasp and pushed against the heavy teak. The door opened far too obligingly on oiled hinges and if not for a sudden lunge to stop its swing it would have crashed into the hallway wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flutter of candlelight shimmied from open doorways<br> to the left and right, and up ahead a room he<br> knew from previous visits to be the kitchen was shining<br> brightly. That was the source of the decadent music.<br> And that, he knew, was where the transients would be<br> gathered. They&#x2019;d attempt to flee through the back door<br> and into the trap he had laid. From his side pack he produced a Russian Lubitel 166. Not the most compact piece of equipment but efficient and easy enough to reload. There would be no mistakes this time. He would have them all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the two men sent to the back had retraced their steps and were now attempting to round the building on the east side. This too was a problem because they were met by a dog, an ugly, mean-spirited dog who stood and snarled. Drool dripped from its fangs. The men stopped in their tracks. They had reached the rear kitchen window through which a bright light shone on to their uncomfortable situation.<br> Fortunately the dog was chained and beneath the window was a motorcycle. By climbing on to its seat they were able to both avoid the dog and see inside the house. Just as their heads appeared at the mosquito screen, the leader and his two men burst into the kitchen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Freeze!&#x2019; shouted the leader and there was a flash, then another from his camera. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t anybody . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there were no transients in the kitchen, just a solitary old man. He was standing naked in a large zinc bathtub. He was up to his shins in bubbly water and<br> held a particularly impressive loofah. Far from being shocked or embarrassed, the old man laughed, turned away from the men, and loofahed his backside with<br> enthusiasm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Search him,&#x2019; shouted the leader. There was no rush to do so. &#x2018;Search all the rooms, the closets, the cupboards, the crawl space beneath the roof.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His head turned in response to some slight movement through the window screen where he saw the faces of the two men who should have been watching<br> the garden.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;What are you doing there?&#x2019; he shouted.<br></p><h2>Trains and Lovers: A Novel</h2><p><p>As they journey by rail from Edinburgh to London, four strangers pass the time by sharing tales of trains that have changed their lives. A keen-eyed Scotsman recounts how he turned a friendship with a coworker into a romance by spotting an anachronistic train in an eighteenth-century painting. An Australian woman shares how her parents fell in love and spent their life together running a railroad siding in the remote Outback. A middle-aged American patron of the arts sees two young men saying goodbye in a train station and recalls his own youthful crush on another man. And a young Englishman describes how exiting his train at the wrong station allowed him to meet an intriguing woman whom he impulsively invited to dinner-and into his life. <br>&nbsp;<br>Here is Alexander McCall Smith at his most subtle and enchanting, exploring the nature of love&#x2014;and trains&#x2014;in this utterly captivating story.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Alexander McCall Smith</b> is the author of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency series, the Isabel Dalhousie series, the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series, the 44 Scotland Street series and the Corduroy Mansions series. He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh and has served with many national and international organizations concerned with bioethics. He lives in Scotland.</p><p>1<br><br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a fishing boat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was. He saw it from the train, but not for more than a minute or two, as the line followed that bit of coastline only for a short time before it suddenly swerved off, as railway lines will do. The view of the North Sea was lost, and trees closed in; there was the blue of the sea one moment and then the blurred green of foliage rapidly passing the window; there was slanting morning sun, like an intermittent signal flashed through the trees.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is the story of four people, all strangers to one another, who met on that train, and of how love touched their lives, in very different ways. Love is nothing out of the ordinary, even if we think it is; even if we idealise it, celebrate it in poetry, sentimentalise it in coy valentines. Love happens to just about everyone; it is like measles or the diseases of childhood; it is as predictable as the losing of milk teeth, or the breaking of a boy&#x2019;s voice. It may visit us at any time, in our youth but also when we are much older and believe we are beyond its reach; but we are not. It has been described as a toothache, a madness, a divine intoxication&#x2014;metaphors that reflect the disturbing effect it has on our lives. It may bring surprise, joy, despair and, occasionally, perfect happiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>But for each person who is made happy by love, there will be many for whom it turns out to be a cause of regret. That is because it can be so fleeting; one moment it may take our breath away, the next it may leave us bereft. When it does that, love can be like a haunting, staying with us for year after year; we know that it is gone, but somehow we persuade ourselves that it is still there. The heart has more than its fair share of ghosts, and these ghosts may be love, in any of its many forms. I knew one who fell deeply in love at nineteen&#x2014;smitten, overwhelmed; astonished to find that all he wanted to think about was the other; unbelieving, at first, that this had happened to him. Thirty years later, he found the person he had loved, to whom timidity, if not shame itself, had prevented him from declaring his feelings, regularly coming to him in his dreams. So much had happened in those intervening years, but none of it had been shared, as life had taken them in very different directions. Nobody would choose to be in love like that, to hold on so strongly to something that was no longer there. Yet we admire such instances of tenacity, finding nobility in loss and in the way in which some people bear it.<br>&nbsp;<br>If it were not for the train journey on that day, these four would never have met. Journeys may be like that, may bring together people who would otherwise never have known of each other&#x2019;s existence. In that respect, long journeys have something in common with military service or boarding school, or even the shared experience of some natural disaster. Such things bring us into contact with people we would never have encountered but for the sharing of danger or unhappiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>Journeys are not only about places, they are also about people, and it may be the people, rather than the places, that we remember. Those with whom one shares a carriage on the Trans-Siberian Railway may well be remembered, even if the names of the places in which the train stops are soon lost. Of Kirov, Perm, Omsk and Ussuriysk, all of them stops on that long journey, most travellers, other than the locals, will probably remember only Omsk&#x2014;for its sheer, prosaic finality, and for the fact that of all possible railway stations in the world, we are here in one called Omsk. I know nothing of Omsk, but it seems to me that its name is redolent of ending, a full stop; not a place for honeymoons or rhapsodies. Omsk.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or Adelstrop. Yes, I remember Adelstrop, for the train stopped there in the heat&#x2014;that is Edward Thomas. The poet was on a train journey into rural Oxfordshire, at a time when there was still an England of quiet villages and hedge-bound fields, and when a train might unexpectedly draw to a halt at a small place and there might be birdsong audible behind the hissing of steam. Nothing happens there, other than the stopping of a train and the escape of pent-up steam, but it brings home how suddenly and surprisingly we may be struck by the beauty of a particular place and moment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Edward Thomas was not alone in sensing the poetic possibilities of the train. Auden&#x2019;s &#x201c;Night Mail&#x201d; is entirely concerned with a rail journey: This is the Night Mail crossing the border / Bringing the cheque and the postal order. You can hear the train in those lines; you can feel its rocking motion.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then there is the poet Kenneth Koch, who while travelling in Kenya came to a railroad crossing at which this sign was posted: One train may hide another. This was meant, of course, as a warning to drivers of the fact that the train you see may not be the only train to reckon with, but it also meant, as Koch points out in his poem, that there are many things in this life that conceal other things. One letter may mean another is on the way; one hitch-hiker may deliberately hide another one by the side of the road; offer to carry one bag and you may find there is another one hidden behind it, with the result that you must carry two. And so on through life. Do not count on things coming in ones.<br>&nbsp;<br>Trains may hide one another, but they may also hide from us what they have in store&#x2014;the meetings, the disclosures, the exchanged glances, the decisions we make or the insights that strike us on a journey. Trains are everyday, prosaic things, but they can be involved in, be the agents of, so much else, including that part of our human life that for so many far outweighs any other&#x2014;our need for love&#x2014;to give it and to receive it in that familiar battle that all of us fight with loneliness.</p></p><h2>Healing Words</h2><p>In this groundbreaking classic linking prayer and health, physician Larry Dossey shares the latest evidence connecting prayer, healing, and medicine. Using real-life examples and personal anecdotes, Dossey proves how prayer can be as valid a healing tool as drugs or surgery. <p> Dossey explores which methods of prayer show the greatest potential for healing; presents compelling evidence that patients' and doctors' belief in a treatment increases its efficacy; explains that discoveries in modern physics allow us to integrate the spiritual and the scientific and make the power of prayer provable in the lab; and much more. </p><p> Provocative, engaging, and powerfully instructive, <em>Healing Words</em> restores the spiritual art of healing to the science of medicine.</p></p><p><p>Larry Dossey, M.D., is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Healing Words,</em> and <em>Prayer Is Good Medicine.</em> An authority on spiritual healing, he lectures throughout the country and has been a frequent guest on <em>Oprah, Good Morning America, CNN,</em> and <em>The Learning Channel.</em> He is responsible for introducing innovations in spiritual care to acclaimed institutions across the country. He currently resides in Santa Fe, New Mexico. </p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Saints and Sinners, <br>Health and Illness</b></p><p><b>What is to give light must endure burning.<br> -- Viktor Frankl</b></p><p>One of the most puzzling illnesses in history took place some 2,500 years ago when the Buddha-the Awakened One -- died from food poisoning, having been fed tainted meat in what proved to be his final meal. Not a very exalted way for a Buddha to go, I thought, on first discovering this account. Somehow I'd expected a more dignified cause of death than spoiled food. Later I found that this case was by no means unique, and that many great spiritual leaders have suffered ignominious ends marked by grotesque pain and suffering. Some of the historically recent examples include:</p><p> --Saint Bernadette, who in 1858 saw the vision of the Virgin at Lourdes, where thousands of healings are claimed to have occurred. Bernadette didn't receive such a healing when she needed one. Cause of death: variously called "bone cancer" or disseminated tuberculosis, at age thirty-five.</p><p> -- Jiddu Krishnamurti, the famous spiritual teacher whose words have inspired millions around the world. Cause of death: cancer of the pancreas.</p><p> --Suzuki Roshi, who brought Zen Buddhism from Japan to the United States and established the San Francisco Zen Center. Cause of death: cancer of the liver.</p><p> -- Sri Ramana Maharshi, the most beloved saint of modem India. Cause of death: cancer of the stomach.</p><p>This list could be multiplied at great length. History is clear: the health records of many of the most majestic, God-realized saints and mystics are far from ideal.</p><p>Often the sickly saints seem to accept illness as part of the natural order. The great Indian sage Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950), one day took a wrong step, fell, and broke his knee. This perplexed the physician who attended him. "How is it that you, a mahatma, could not foresee and prevent this accident?" "I still have to carry this human body about me," Aurobindo replied, "and it is subject to ordinary human limitations and physical laws."</p><p>The "explanations" offered for these events are numerous. Some say the saint or mystic wasn't <i>really</i> as spiritual as he or she seemed. Or that he or she was indeed enlightened but was living out his or her karma, "paying back" for transgressions and shortcomings of previous lives. Others maintain that the great teacher has inadvertently taken on the illness of his or her devotees, like an unconscious sponge. We also hear the argument that the wise one has consciously chosen the illness. Sometimes this is done as a teaching device, in order to demonstrate that the connection between the divine and the human can remain even in the midst of hideous illness. Or the saint or mystic intentionally takes on the illness as a final test, to "bum off " any remaining vestiges of ego or self-consciousness.</p><p>These may or may not be valid reasons. Our task here is not to figure out in every case why God-realized people get sick and die, but simply to acknowledge that they obviously do -- and to ask what this might imply when illness occurs in our own lives. Above all, these accounts should make us question seriously the prevalent assumptions that (a) being holy is a guarantee of good health, and that (b) bad health and illness always imply spiritual shortcomings.</p><p>These assumptions are untrue not just for spiritual geniuses, but also for common folk like you and me. When Jesus encountered a man who was blind from birth, his disciples asked, "Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?" This question comes in a variety of "New Age" contexts today. Who is at fault? Why did I "choose" this illness? For what current or previous shortcomings am I suffering? Who's to blame? Jesus' answer is illuminating, and should be emblazoned in every New Age book dealing with consciousness and healing: "Neither bath this man sinned, nor his parents. but that the works of God should be made manifest in him" (John 9:1-3, King James Version (KJV), emphasis added). How could Jesus' message be clearer? This is a striking example of a profound physical problem in the total absence of spiritual imperfection. No one fell short, nobody was being punished for sin, nobody chose to be sick. Jesus implies also that there may be a higher purpose to the illness that we simply cannot grasp because we do not know the ways of the Absolute. This means that the meaning of a particular disease may be cosmic-that is, it may be opaque and hidden to us mortals, known only to the Divine. On balance, this case warns against equating spiritual and physical health, and cautions us against attributing shallow, superficial meaning to illness.</p><p>But the sickly saints and mystics are only one side of the coin. They are mirrored by what we could call the healthy reprobates -- individuals who have no obvious spiritual inclinations whatever, but who never get sick. Almost everyone knows or has heard of such a person. They break all the rules of good health, smoke and drink with abandon, and five to be a hundred without ever falling ill.</p><p>Sickly saints and healthy sinners show us that there is no invariable, linear, one-to-one relationship between one's level of spiritual attainment and the degree of one's physical health. It is obvious that one can attain immense spiritual heights and still get <i>very</i> sick.</p><p>Many people who believe in an invariable relationship between physical health and spiritual attainment accept the concept of "the Divine within," " the belief that an element or quality of the Supreme Being dwells inside every human. But even though the Divine may be present in everyone, it is obvious that human beings are imperfect reflectors, as it were, of the Divine Light. We fall short every day in a million ways. just as we may contain an element of the Divine, our physical bodies may contain something of our spiritual essence, which they sometimes reflect as imperfectly as we reflect the Divine. </p></p><h2>Silver Bastard (Silver Valley)</h2><p><b>First in the new Silver Valley series from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Reapers Motorcycle Club Novels </b><br><br>Fourteen months.

Tequila hit my stomach, the alcohol shocking my system, and shit finally got real.</p><p>Freedom.</p><p>Fourteen months since the last time I&#x2019;d had a decent drink&#x2014;all but forgotten what it felt like, too. That sweet, harsh pain that comes from losing the surface layer of skin all the way down your throat? Gorgeous. Never felt better in my life, and that&#x2019;s a fact. Helped that the queen of body shots had sucked me off right after we&#x2019;d pulled up to the party.</p><p>Spent the last year trying to decide what I&#x2019;d do first when I finally got out. Kept going back and forth between getting laid and getting drunk, but God apparently has a soft spot for assholes because we&#x2019;d found one hell of a good compromise.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been free nearly four hours now. Still felt like a dream. The California Department of Corrections took its own sweet time with everything, up to and including processing a man out. I&#x2019;d spent half the wait wondering if the cockwads would change their minds or if the club lawyer had forgotten something. Figured they&#x2019;d find some way to fuck with my head.</p><p>FBI, state cops, even Homeland Security&#x2014;they all wanted a piece of my club, the Silver Bastards MC, and not a week went by inside that they didn&#x2019;t try to cut it out of my hide. Guess they figured a prospect made an easy target.</p><p>Not fucking likely.</p><p>My old man <i>died </i>for the Bastards. If I turned, he&#x2019;d haunt my ass the rest of my life because that shit does not stand in my family. I&#x2019;d been born to wear a Bastard cut. And tonight? For the first time I finally had the right to show those colors off.</p><p>A hand slapped my shoulder, then a burly man caught me up in a hug so tight it hurt. My fucking ribs creaked.</p><p>&#x201c;That patch feel right on your back, brother?&#x201d; asked Boonie. He was the president of the Silver Bastards in Callup, Idaho, and I&#x2019;d heard him call me a hell of a lot of things&#x2014;but never brother. Felt good. Damned good. Until an hour ago, I&#x2019;d been a prospect and I&#x2019;d never gotten any special treatment because of my old man. That&#x2019;s how I wanted it.</p><p>&#x201c;Best night of my life,&#x201d; I admitted. He pulled back, and his face grew serious.</p><p>&#x201c;Proud of you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You did what you had to. Protected the club, took care of business. Painter told us how things were inside, how you took his back. You earned this, earned it with your life and your blood. I know you won&#x2019;t shame this patch, Puck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I replied, his words almost too much. Boonie grinned suddenly, then grabbed my arm and turned me toward the bar again.</p><p>&#x201c;Drink up,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;Then find yourself some pretty little thing to play with, because tomorrow we&#x2019;re ridin&#x2019; home. Your bike&#x2019;s in good shape&#x2014;took care of it for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Another shot, baby?&#x201d; the stripper asked. She rolled onto her side, reaching out to catch my neck with her hand, pulling me in for a kiss. That brought me a little too close to her face. She was sweaty, and her mascara had started running. Didn&#x2019;t smell that great, either.</p><p>&#x201c;More shots,&#x201d; I said, pulling away. I&#x2019;d appreciated the blow job, no question. But she wasn&#x2019;t exactly the fantasy I&#x2019;d been jacking off to the last year and I&#x2019;d promised myself I wouldn&#x2019;t settle once I got out. I wanted someone fresh&#x2014;someone clean and soft and sweet enough to eat. I&#x2019;d play with her for a while before letting myself go, punching through all that softness until she screamed and begged for mercy.</p><p>Mouth, cunt, ass.</p><p>That&#x2019;d been what got me through those long nights wondering why the fuck I&#x2019;d let myself get caught.</p><p>Ignoring the bitch on the bar, I reached across and grabbed the bottle of tequila, chugging nearly a third of it down. Christ, there went the rest of my throat. Then I turned to look out across the room. Four of my new Silver Bastard brothers had come down from Callup&#x2014;Boonie, Miner, Deep, and Demon. Joining them were four Reapers and two Reaper prospects. They were here to welcome Painter, who&#x2019;d gone down with me on a weapons charge. This sucked, but such is life. We&#x2019;d been fighting for our clubs, so no regrets there. Through a combination of luck and well-placed payoffs, we&#x2019;d managed to stick together for the duration of our time served. The clubs provided the funds and the attorneys&#x2014;to protect them, we matched that investment with our silence.</p><p>Painter caught my eye from across the room, grinning. After so much time together I could almost read his thoughts. I gave him a nod, one of those chin jerks that speaks volumes.</p><p><i>Congrats to you, too, asshole.</i></p><p>&#x201c;You havin&#x2019; fun?&#x201d; a man asked. I looked down to find a painfully skinny, greasy little man missing half his teeth standing next to me. Tweaker called Teeny. His face was just a little too eager, his eyes a little too bright. Unfortunately, Teeny was our host for the night so I had to be nice to him. We were out in the middle of nowhere, tucked back in a canyon where this douche had somehow acquired a house. The Longnecks MC&#x2014;one of our &#x201c;allies,&#x201d; although their loyalty was questionable&#x2014;had a warehouse set up in a shop right next to this guy&#x2019;s house.</p><p>This Teeny asshole wasn&#x2019;t even part of the club&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. apparently his brother Bax was patched in, though, so they used him as a pit stop. Something didn&#x2019;t quite add up about the situation, but fuck if I cared. In the morning I&#x2019;d be riding for home. With luck my future association with the state of California in general and Teeny in particular would be extremely limited.</p><p>&#x201c;See anything you like?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my old lady, there. You want her? She&#x2019;s real good, welcome you home right.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged, glancing over toward his woman. She was probably in her midthirties, I decided. Pretty enough, but she had a hard, tired look around her eyes that didn&#x2019;t appeal. Not only that, she was wiry and skinny as fuck. Probably smoking meth to block out the fact that she had to live with this dickwad.</p><p>&#x201c;No, she&#x2019;s great but not my type,&#x201d; I said, casually taking another drink of tequila. Wasn&#x2019;t burning so much now, which in retrospect should&#x2019;ve been a sign to slow down. Maybe things would&#x2019;ve turned out different.</p><p>Shitty thing about time&#x2014;only runs the one direction.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your type?&#x201d; he asked. I shrugged. The day I needed some tweaker to find me pussy, I&#x2019;d cut off my own cock and get it over with. Swallowing another drink, I glanced across the room, pointedly ignoring him.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I saw her.</p><p>Now, I fuckin&#x2019; hate clich�s, and shit like this only happens in movies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I swear to fuck, I think I fell for her in that instant. She was small, with long brown hair in one of those knot things on top of her head. Not dressed to show off her figure, either. I could still see she had a tiny waist, though, along with generous tits and the kind of round, healthy curves you just know will cradle your hips perfectly when you&#x2019;re pounding her.</p><p>I had to have her.</p><p>Like, needed her. Now.</p><p>&#x201c;Good call,&#x201d; Teeny said. I ignored him, focusing on the angel I had every intention of owning just as soon as I talked her out of her pants. God, she was pretty. Kind of out of place, too. Not flirting with anyone, and not a ton of makeup. Just wandering around, picking up empties, and avoiding conversation. Fascinating.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll introduce you.&#x201d;</p><p>Teeny walked across the room toward my Dream Fuck. I started after him, because I didn&#x2019;t want the asshole speaking on my behalf. Then Boonie caught my arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Heads-up,&#x201d; he said, his voice pitched low, difficult to hear through the noise of the party. &#x201c;We think somethin&#x2019;s going on with that guy. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to talk him up, okay? Can always use good information.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded, wondering why the fuck Teeny had to pick me to buddy up with. Tonight was for relaxing, enjoying myself. Just looking at him made me feel dirty, and considering some of the shit I&#x2019;ve pulled in my life, that&#x2019;s an accomplishment. Another hand slapped my back, then Painter caught me by the neck, squeezing me as he laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;Never ends,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Boonie cock-blocking you?&#x201d;</p><p>I punched him in the gut&#x2014;not hard. Just enough to make him back off.</p><p>&#x201c;No, right now you have that honor,&#x201d; I muttered, glaring at him. &#x201c;Christ, we just spent a year together in a fuckin&#x2019; cell. Think we&#x2019;ve covered everything, so let me get laid? Please?&#x201d;</p><p>He answered by punching me back, and I reeled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. damn, hadn&#x2019;t realized how drunk I&#x2019;d gotten. Still, I wasn&#x2019;t about to go down easy. I swayed, watching him as our brothers started crowding around us. The wild gleam in his eyes&#x2014;a mixture of almost manic happiness and pent-up energy&#x2014;matched my own.</p><p>&#x201c;Take it outside,&#x201d; Boonie said. &#x201c;I got fifty on Puck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hundred on Painter,&#x201d; Picnic Hayes, the Reapers&#x2019; president, answered and then we were bundled outside for the fight.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t wait.</p><p>We&#x2019;d sparred before, of course. Nothing but time to kill in the pen, so I knew Painter&#x2019;s moves like they were my own&#x2014;and he knew mine, too. We were a good match, could go either way. Neither of us had much in the way of formal training but we&#x2019;d both picked up a fair amount along the way. Hell, I&#x2019;d gotten caught in my first bar fight when I was fourteen years old, seeing as my pop wasn&#x2019;t exactly Father of the Year material. Still loved the old bastard, though.</p><p>The sun was fading as we stepped outside, painting the sky in pinks and oranges shot through with smudged clouds. I paused a moment, struck by the incredible beauty all around me, and smiled, breathing deep. So fucking good to be outside again. Nobody knows what it&#x2019;s like, trapped in a cell like an animal. Nobody but the guys who&#x2019;ve heard the sound of those gates closing behind them.</p><p>Fortunately for me, I wasn&#x2019;t exactly the first Silver Bastard to do time for the club, which meant my brothers got me. They knew what this was like.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, we got a circle here,&#x201d; Pic was saying. I blinked, starting to process the fact that maybe boxing with Painter while I was drunk might not be such a hot idea. Of course, he was drunk, too, and the booze would numb the pain&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;Fight goes until one of you is down or taps out. Time to make your bets, brothers.&#x201d;</p><p>Boonie caught my arm, pulling me to the side and looking into my face.</p><p>&#x201c;You ready?&#x201d; he asked. I nodded sharply, because drunk or not, I wasn&#x2019;t going to pussy out in front of my president on the same day I got my colors. I glanced across the dusty circle to see Painter, who gave me a friendly sneer. Laughing, I flipped him off, then shook my arms out, loosening up.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I saw her again. Off to the side, standing next to Teeny, who was talking rapidly and pointing to me. I frowned, because I really didn&#x2019;t need or want that asshole on my side. Knowing my luck, the fucker would send her running. I nudged my brother, Deep, who was standing next to me.</p><p>&#x201c;See that girl?&#x201d; I asked, jerking my chin toward her. &#x201c;Make sure Teeny doesn&#x2019;t scare her off, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep an eye out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>Painter and I stepped into the circle together, and I felt the thrill of adrenaline cut through the haze of alcohol. My blood started pumping, pounding through me until I could all but taste it. Christ, but I loved to fight. Always seemed to clear my head, and I&#x2019;d gotten good enough over the years that I won more than I lost. Inside, those skills had saved our asses, and I&#x2019;d picked up my fair share of pointers from the very man I found myself facing.</p><p>Painter moved first, coming in with an experimental jab toward my stomach. This wasn&#x2019;t a real attack, just him testing my limits. I&#x2019;d had a lot to drink, which would slow my reflexes. So had he. That changed the baseline, something we both needed to feel out.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t believe they gave you a top rocker,&#x201d; he said, taunting me. I grinned.</p><p>&#x201c;Try harder, old man. I know you too well.&#x201d;</p><p>Painter laughed, then came at me again, suddenly. He punched me square in the stomach and I doubled over. Shit. I fell back and almost stumbled out of the ring, catching myself at the last minute. I heard the shouts of my brothers urging me on.</p><p>Oh, hell no.</p><p>No fucking way I&#x2019;d lose a fight tonight. Painter could fuck right off, because he&#x2019;d had his colors for years. This was <i>my</i> night. I owned this bitch and he&#x2019;d just have to suck it up and deal.</p><p>Still staggering, I lurched forward toward him like I was out of control. Then I attacked, and this time I caught him. One hit, two. Three. Right in the gut. Painter gasped and I moved in for the kill.</p><p>Somehow he pulled himself together, catching me across the chin. My entire head rattled as I staggered to the side. I felt blood in my mouth, then found a loose tooth with my tongue.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>I thought of the pretty girl I&#x2019;d just seen, which pissed me off. The anger was good. Cleared my head. Didn&#x2019;t matter if I won or not, she wouldn&#x2019;t want to suck face with someone bleeding like a stuck pig. This wasn&#x2019;t a fight&#x2014;it was a cock-block.</p><p>Time to end it.</p><p>Painter waited for me, swaying. I&#x2019;d gotten him pretty good. He was definitely favoring his left hand, which was great news because he was left-handed. Lucky me. I was ambidextrous.</p><p>I launched myself at him, turning that to my advantage.</p><p>He tried to block me but his arm was weak. I landed a blow to his gut followed by one that caught the side of his cheek. Pain seared through my hand, parting the fog of alcohol.</p><p>&#x201c;Dick,&#x201d; he managed to gasp as I danced back, flexing my fingers. That last one had been bad&#x2014;if I&#x2019;d been any more off-center, I&#x2019;d have a fist full of broken bones.</p><p>&#x201c;You got him,&#x201d; Boonie shouted. I stretched my hand again. Did I want to risk another head blow? I hadn&#x2019;t even wrapped my knuckles&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>I caught his chin again and Painter went down, falling hard. Blood dribbled from his nose and for long seconds I wondered if I&#x2019;d actually hurt him for real.</p><p>Then he managed to roll onto his stomach, tapping out and flipping me off, all in one gesture.</p><p>&#x201c;Congrats on getting your colors, Puck,&#x201d; he groaned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you this one. Enjoy it while you can because next time I&#x2019;m killing you.&#x201d;</p><p>I staggered back, grinning and raising my hands once I realized he wasn&#x2019;t seriously hurt. It&#x2019;d been a lucky shot and we both knew it&#x2014;we were well matched, could&#x2019;ve gone either way. As I heard my brothers shouting in victory I didn&#x2019;t care. This was my night. I had my freedom and my patch.</p><p>Still needed that girl, though.</p><p>I looked around and spotted her standing next to Deep. Teeny stood on the other side of him, looking all sorry for himself. She was hugging herself with both arms, obviously nervous, and I felt my smile fade. Shit. I hadn&#x2019;t wanted her scared. I shook my head, wishing things weren&#x2019;t moving so fast. Waving off the men crowding around me, I headed toward her, half expecting her to run off.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t, though.</p><p>As I came to a stop in front of her, she gave me a wav...</p></p><h2>Battles That Changed History</h2><p>Review: Any map fan will have an absolute field day with Battles That Changed History, as its many sumptuously crafted maps intricately detail the battles in question with beautiful clarity.

Between 1901 and 1904 she was the superintendent of a hall of residence for female students at Glasgow University, but, otherwise, she appears to have made her living throughout her life by writing. She was unmarried. As is made clear by the Prefaces of her books from time to time, she travelled extensively after 1904, including to Melbourne, California and China, although her obituary in The Times stated that she spent most of her life in Oxford and in London, where she died. H. E. Marshall is famous for her 1905 children's history of England, Our Island Story: A History of England for Boys and Girls, illustrated by A. S. Forrest. In the USA the book was entitled An Island Story. The book was a bestseller, was printed in numerous editions, and for fifty years was the standard and much-loved book by which children learned the history of England. However a lot of this book is historically inaccurate, much of it uses Shakespeare's plays for historical sources, like the section of Richard III is really a summary of the play.[citation needed] The book is still to be found in schools and homes, but the last printing was in 1953 and it went out of print in the 1960s. In 2005, an alliance of the Civitas think-tank and various national newspapers brought the book back into print, with the aim of sending a free copy to each of the UK's primary schools. Readers of The Daily Telegraph contributed �25,000 to the cost of the reprint.</p><h2>Mind and Image: An Essay on Art and Architecture</h2><p>Book by Greene, Herb</p><p></p><h2>Fifty Shades Freed</h2><p>When unworldly student Ana Steele first encountered the driven, damaged young entrepreneur Christian Grey, it sparked a sensual affair that changed both their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and ultimately repelled by Christian&#39;s singular sexual tastes, Ana demanded a deeper commitment; determined to keep her, Christian agreed. Now, together, they have more-love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of infinite possibilities. But Ana always knew that loving her Fifty Shades would not be easy and being together poses challenges neither of them ever anticipated. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian&#39;s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own integrity, identity, or independence; Christian must somehow overcome his compulsion to control and lay to rest the horrors that blighted his past and haunt his present. Just when it seems that together their love can conquer any obstacle, tragedy, malice and fate combine to make Ana&#39;s worst nightmares come true. Alone and desperate, she must face down the poisoned legacy of Christian&#39;s past. Seductive, shocking, sad, and funny, Fifty Shades Freed is the compelling final volume in the Fifty Shades trilogy.</p><p><b>E L James</b> is a former TV executive, wife, and mother of two based in the leafy suburbs of West London.

I brush her hair because she likes that. She doesn&#x2019;t wake up. I shake her. Mommy! My tummy hurts. It is hungry. He isn&#x2019;t here. I am thirsty. In the kitchen I pull a chair to the sink, and I have a drink. The water splashes over my blue sweater. Mommy is still asleep. Mommy wake up! She lies still. She is cold. I fetch my blankie, and I cover Mommy, and I lie down on the sticky green rug beside her. Mommy is still asleep. I have two toy cars. They race by the floor where Mommy is sleeping. I think Mommy is sick. I search for something to eat. In the freezer I find peas. They are cold. I eat them slowly. They make my tummy hurt. I sleep beside Mommy. The peas are gone. In the freezer is something. It smells funny. I lick it and my tongue is stuck to it. I eat it slowly. It tastes nasty. I drink some water. I play with my cars, and I sleep beside Mommy. Mommy is so cold, and she won&#x2019;t wake up. The door crashes open. I cover Mommy with my blankie. He&#x2019;s here. <i>Fuck. What the fuck happened here? Oh, the crazy fucked-up bitch. Shit. Fuck. Get out of my way, you little shit.</i> He kicks me, and I hit my head on the floor. My head hurts. He calls somebody and he goes. He locks the door. I lay down beside Mommy. My head hurts. The lady policeman is here. No. No. No. Don&#x2019;t touch me. Don&#x2019;t touch me. Don&#x2019;t touch me. I stay by Mommy. No. Stay away from me. The lady policeman has my blankie, and she grabs me. I scream. Mommy! Mommy! I want my mommy. The words are gone. I can&#x2019;t say the words. Mommy can&#x2019;t hear me. I have no words.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian! Christian!&#x201d; Her voice is urgent, pulling him from the depths of his nightmare, the depths of his despair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here. I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He wakes and she&#x2019;s leaning over him, grasping his shoulders, shaking him, her face etched with anguish, blue eyes wide and brimming with tears.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ana.&#x201d; His voice is a breathless whisper, the taste of fear tarnishing his mouth. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I had a dream . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m here, I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ana.&#x201d; He breathes her name, and it&#x2019;s a talisman against the black choking panic coursing through his body.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hush, I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d; She curls around him, her limbs cocooning him, her warmth leeching into his body, forcing back the shadows, forcing back the fear. She is sunshine, she is light . . . she is his.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please let&#x2019;s not fight.&#x201d; His voice is hoarse as he wraps his arms around her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The vows. No obeying. I can do that. We&#x2019;ll find a way.&#x201d; The words rush out of his mouth in a tumble of emotion and confusion and anxiety.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. We will. We&#x2019;ll always find a way,&#x201d; she whispers, and her lips are on his, silencing him, bringing him back to the now.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> I stare up through gaps in the sea-grass parasol at the bluest of skies, summer blue, Mediterranean blue, with a contented sigh. Christian is beside me, stretched out on a sun lounge. My husband&#x2014;my hot, beautiful husband, shirtless and in cut-off jeans&#x2014;is reading a book predicting the collapse of the Western banking system. By all accounts, it&#x2019;s a page-turner. I haven&#x2019;t seen him sit this still, ever. He looks more like a student than the hotshot CEO of one of the top privately owned companies in the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the final leg of our honeymoon, we laze in the afternoon sun on the beach of the aptly named Beach Plaza Monte Carlo in Monaco, although we&#x2019;re not actually staying in this hotel. I open my eyes and gaze out at the <i>Fair Lady</i> anchored in the harbor. We are staying, of course, on board a luxury motor yacht. Built in 1928, she floats majestically on the water, queen of all the yachts in the harbor. She looks like a child&#x2019;s wind-up toy. Christian loves her&#x2014;I suspect he&#x2019;s tempted to buy her. Honestly, boys and their toys.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sitting back, I listen to the Christian Grey mix on my new iPod and doze in the late afternoon sun, idly remembering his proposal. Oh, his dreamy proposal in the boathouse . . . I can almost smell the scent of the meadow flowers . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can we marry tomorrow?&#x201d; Christian murmurs softly in my ear. I am sprawled on his chest in the flowery bower in the boathouse, sated from our passionate lovemaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that a yes?&#x201d; I hear his hopeful surprise.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A no?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sense his grin. &#x201c;Miss Steele, are you incoherent?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I grin. &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He laughs and hugs me tightly, kissing the top of my head. &#x201c;Vegas, tomorrow, it is then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sleepily I raise my head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think my parents would be very happy with that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He thrums his fingertips up and down my naked back, caressing me gently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you want, Anastasia? Vegas? A big wedding with all the trimmings? Tell me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not big . . . Just friends and family.&#x201d; I gaze up at him, moved by the quiet entreaty in his glowing gray eyes. <i>What does he want?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; He nods. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shrug.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could we do it here?&#x201d; he asks tentatively.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your folks&#x2019; place? Would they mind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He snorts. &#x201c;My mother would be in seventh heaven.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, here. I&#x2019;m sure my mom and dad would prefer that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He strokes my hair. Could I be any happier?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So, we&#x2019;ve established where, now the when.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Surely you should ask your mother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; Christian&#x2019;s smile dips. &#x201c;She can have a month, that&#x2019;s it. I want you too much to wait any longer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian, you have me. You&#x2019;ve had me for a while. But okay&#x2014;a month it is.&#x201d; I kiss his chest, a soft chaste kiss, and smile up at him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll burn,&#x201d; Christian whispers in my ear, startling me from my doze.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only for you.&#x201d; I give him my sweetest smile. The late afternoon sun has shifted, and I am under its full glare. He smirks and in one swift move pulls my sun lounge into the shade of the parasol.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Out of the Mediterranean sun, Mrs. Grey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank you for your altruism, Mr. Grey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My pleasure, Mrs. Grey, and I&#x2019;m not being altruistic at all. If you burn, I won&#x2019;t be able to touch you.&#x201d; He raises an eyebrow, his eyes shining with mirth, and my heart expands. &#x201c;But I suspect you know that and you&#x2019;re laughing at me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would I?&#x201d; I gasp, feigning innocence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you would and you do. Often. It&#x2019;s one of the many things I love about you.&#x201d; He leans down and kisses me, playfully biting my lower lip.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d rub me down with more sunscreen.&#x201d; I pout against his lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mrs. Grey, it&#x2019;s a dirty job . . . but that&#x2019;s an offer I can&#x2019;t refuse. Sit up,&#x201d; he orders, his voice husky. I do as I&#x2019;m told, and with slow meticulous strokes from strong and supple fingers, he coats me in sunscreen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You really are very lovely. I&#x2019;m a lucky man,&#x201d; he murmurs as his fingers skim over my breasts, spreading the lotion.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, you are, Mr. Grey.&#x201d; I gaze coyly up at him through my lashes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Modesty becomes you, Mrs. Grey. Turn over. I want to do your back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Smiling, I roll over, and he undoes the back strap of my hideously expensive bikini.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How would you feel if I went topless, like the other women on the beach?&#x201d; I ask.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Displeased,&#x201d; he says without hesitation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not very happy about you wearing so little right now.&#x201d; He leans down and whispers in my ear. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t push your luck.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that a challenge, Mr. Grey?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s a statement of fact, Mrs. Grey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I sigh and shake my head. <i>Oh, Christian . . . my possessive, jealous, control freak Christian.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When he&#x2019;s finished, he slaps my behind.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do, wench.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His ever-present, ever-active BlackBerry buzzes. I frown and he smirks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My eyes only, Mrs. Grey.&#x201d; He raises his eyebrow in playful warning, slaps my backside once more, and sits back down on his lounger to take the call.<br> &nbsp;<br> My inner goddess purrs. Maybe tonight we could do some kind of floor show for his eyes only. She smirks knowingly, arching a brow. I grin at the thought and drift back into my afternoon siesta.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Mam&#x2019;selle? Un Perrier pour moi, un Coca-Cola light pour ma femme, s&#x2019;il vous plait. Et quelque chose a manger . . . laissezmoi voir la carte.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Hmm . . . Christian speaking fluent French wakes me. My eyelashes flutter in the glare of the sun, and I find Christian watching me while a liveried young woman walks away, her tray held aloft, her high blonde ponytail swinging provocatively.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thirsty?&#x201d; he asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I mutter sleepily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I could watch you all day. Tired?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I flush. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get much sleep last night.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me neither.&#x201d; He grins, puts down his BlackBerry, and stands. His shorts fall a little and hang . . . in that way so his swim trunks are visible beneath. Christian takes his shorts off, stepping out of his flip-flops. I lose my train of thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come for a swim with me.&#x201d; He holds out his hand while I look up at him, dazed. &#x201c;Swim?&#x201d; he says again, cocking his head to one side, an amused expression on his face. When I don&#x2019;t respond, he shakes his head slowly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think you need a wake-up call.&#x201d; Suddenly he pounces and lifts me into his arms while I shriek, more from surprise than alarm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian! Put me down!&#x201d; I squeal.<br> &nbsp;<br> He chuckles. &#x201c;Only in the sea, baby.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Several sunbathers on the beach watch with that bemused disinterest so typical, I now realize, of the French, as Christian carries me to the sea, laughing, and wades in.<br> &nbsp;<br> I clasp my arms around his neck. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I say breathlessly, trying to stifle my giggling.<br> &nbsp;<br> He grins. &#x201c;Oh, Ana, baby, have you learned nothing in the short time we&#x2019;ve known each other?&#x201d; He kisses me, and I seize my opportunity, running my fingers through his hair, grasping two handfuls and kissing him back while invading his mouth with my tongue. He inhales sharply and leans back, eyes smoky but wary.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know your game,&#x201d; he whispers and slowly sinks into the cool, clear water, taking me with him as his lips find mine once more. The chill of the Mediterranean is soon forgotten as I wrap myself around my husband.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I thought you wanted to swim,&#x201d; I murmur against his mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very distracting.&#x201d; Christian grazes his teeth along my lower lip. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure I want the good people of Monte Carlo to see my wife in the throes of passion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I run my teeth along his jaw, his stubble tickly against my tongue, not caring a dime for the good people of Monte Carlo.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ana,&#x201d; he groans. He wraps my ponytail around his wrist and tugs gently, tilting my head back, exposing my throat. He trails kisses from my ear down my neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shall I take you in the sea?&#x201d; he breathes. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I whisper.<br> &nbsp;<br> Christian pulls away and gazes down at me, his eyes warm, wanting, and amused. &#x201c;Mrs. Grey, you&#x2019;re insatiable and so brazen. What sort of monster have I created?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A monster fit for you. Would you have me any other way?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you any way I can get you, you know that. But not right now. Not with an audience.&#x201d; He jerks his head toward the shore.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>What?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Sure enough, several sunbathers on the beach have aban-doned their indifference and now regard us with interest. Suddenly, Christian grabs me around my waist and launches me into the air, letting me fall into the water and sink beneath the waves to the soft sand below. I surface, coughing, spluttering, and giggling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Christian!&#x201d; I scold, glaring at him. I thought we were going to make love in the sea . . . and chalk up yet another first. He bites his lower lip to stifle his amusement. I splash him, and he splashes me right back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have all night,&#x201d; he says, grinning like a fool. &#x201c;Laters, baby.&#x201d; He dives beneath the sea and surfaces three feet away from me, then in a fluid, graceful crawl, swims away from the shore, away from me.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Gah! Playful, tantalizing Fifty!</i> I shield my eyes from the sun as I watch him go. He&#x2019;s such a tease . . . what can I do to get him back? While I swim to the shore, I contemplate my options. At the lounges our drinks have arrived, and I take a quick sip of Diet Coke. Christian is a faint speck in the distance.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Hmm . . .</i> I lie down on my front and, fumbling with the straps, take my bikini top off and toss it casually onto Christian&#x2019;s sun lounge. There . . . see how brazen I can be, Mr. Grey. Put this in your pipe and smoke it. I shut my eyes and let the sun warm my skin . . . warm my bones, and I drift away under its heat, my thoughts turning to my wedding day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> -----<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You may kiss the bride,&#x201d; Reverend Walsh announces.<br> &nbsp;<br> I beam at my husband.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Finally, you&#x2019;re mine,&#x201d; he whispers and pulls me into his arms and kisses me chastely on the lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am married. I am Mrs. Christian Grey. I am giddy with joy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You look beautiful, Ana,&#x201d; he murmurs and smiles, his eyes glowing with love . . . and something darker, something hot. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let anyone take that dress off but me, understand?&#x201d; His smile heats a hundred degrees as his fingertips trail down my cheek, igniting my blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Holy crap . . . How does he do this, even here with all these people staring at us?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I nod mutely. Jeez, I hope no one can hear us. Luckily Reverend Walsh has discreetly stepped back. I glance at the throng gathered in their wedding finery . . . My mom, Ray, Bob, and the Greys are all applauding&#x2014;even Kate, my maid of honor, who looks stunning in pale pink as she stands beside Christian&#x2019;s best man, his brother Elliot. Who knew that even Elliot could scrub up so well? All wear huge, beaming smiles&#x2014;except Grace, who weeps graciously into a dainty white handkerchief.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ready to party, Mrs. Grey?&#x201d; Christian murmurs, giving me his shy smile. I melt. He looks divine in a simple black tux with silver waistcoat and tie. He&#x2019;s so . . . <i>dashing.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ready as I&#x2019;ll ever be.&#x201d; I grin, a totally goofy smile on my face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later the wedding party is in full swing . . . Carrick and Grace have gone to town. They have the tent set up again and beautifully decorated in pale pink, silver, and ivory with its sides open, facing the bay. We have been blessed with fine weather, and the late afternoon sun shines over the water. There&#x2019;s a dance floor at one end of the tent, a lavish buffet at the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ray and my mother are dancing and...</p><h2>Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork: A 12-Stop Program to End Bad Habits and Begin a Healthy Lifestyle</h2><p>Recounts the experiences of the Arkansas governor who changed his diet and lifestyle to lose weight, and presents the program he followed along with advice on how to maintain health and an ideal body weight.</p><p>At the completion of his ten-and-a-half-year tenure as governor, Mike Huckabee was the second-longest-serving governor in the nation at that time, having entered office as one of the youngest in the nation.

I knew that Daddy had been secretly planning some surprises, but I was not prepared for all that he had done. The moment the morning sun nudged my eyes open, I heard the gentle tinkling notes of "Happy Birthday to You." With sleepy eyes I gazed at a precious and dazzling merry-go-round spinning a menagerie of animals around a ballerina who danced at its center.<br><br>"I hope you always wake with a smile like that, Summer," Daddy said.<br><br>I looked up and saw Daddy standing there. His face was glowing almost as much as mine. I had his turquoise eyes, but Mommy's ebony hair and a complexion a few shades lighter so anyone could see that I had also clearly inherited Daddy's freckles, especially at the crests of my cheeks.<br><br>"Happy birthday, sweetheart," he said and leaned over to kiss me on the cheek.<br><br>Mommy watched from her wheelchair on the opposite side of my bed. For a moment she looked so distant, almost as though she was on the outside of a great glass bubble set around me. I knew she was having one of those Evil Eye thoughts, those fears that whenever she was too happy, something terrible would happen. She seemed to realize it herself and brightened quickly into a smile. I rose to hug her.<br><br>"What were the two of you doing?" I cried as the merry-go-round continued. "Sitting here waiting for me to wake up? How long have you been here?"<br><br>"We were watching you all night," Daddy joked. "We took turns, didn't we, Rain?"<br><br>"Practically," Mommy said. "Your crazy father has been acting as if this was more his birthday than yours." She jokingly put on a look of disapproval. "More and more these days, he acts like a sixteen-year-old."<br><br>"You never lose the child within you entirely," Daddy assured us. "I want to blow out candles on my ninetieth birthday and unwrap presents. Don't forget to arrange for that, you two," he ordered, sounding like it was just around the corner.<br><br>Mommy shook her head and smiled at me as if the two of us were allies forced to tolerate another foolish man. Daddy could never be a foolish man to me, never, ever, I thought.<br><br>"It's a beautiful merry-go-round," I said as it stopped.<br><br>"That," my mother said, "is not even the tip of the iceberg. Look out the window," she urged me.<br><br>My room overlooked the lake. Grandmother Megan told me it had once been her room, and Mommy said she used it when she had first arrived. Now, she and Daddy used what was Grandmother Hudson's room, only they had changed the decor and replaced all the furniture. The bathroom had been updated to provide for Mommy's special needs.<br><br>In the beginning Mommy didn't want to make dramatic changes in the house. She said she felt an obligation to Grandmother Hudson's memory to keep it close to how it had been, but in time rugs wore, walls had to be repainted, fixtures replaced, appliances changed, and Daddy brought in a decorator to give it all what they called a more eclectic style.<br><br>The hallways still had the spirit of the nineteenth century with some Federal antiques, like a White and Dogswell clock that hung across from a circular mirror of that period. Mommy was very proud of all the antiques left by my Grandmother Hudson. Mommy had loved her very much, so much that I was jealous and wished I had been able to know her, too.<br>ard<br><br>Grandfather Hudson's office was the same as it had always been, but much of the rest of the house -- the living room, the kitchen, my bedroom and Daddy and Mommy's -- had been modernized with lighter colors and softer fabrics. Recently my parents had redone the maid's quarters, covering the floor with a thick white shag rug and replacing what had been a hospital bed with a queen-size cherry wood one; this pleased Mrs. Geary very much.<br><br>After Glenda had married Uncle Roy and she and Harley had moved out of the main house, Mommy and Daddy hired Mrs. Geary through an agency. She was in her early forties at the time and had come from Ireland to live and work in America when she was in her late twenties. Now streaked with gray, her hair had once been almost as red as Daddy's. She had been working for her distant American relatives who she said treated her as badly as Cinderella's stepmother treated Cinderella.<br><br>"There was no respect. Everything I did was simply expected, too. Not an ounce of gratitude! I was glad to get out of there," she told me.<br><br>Daddy said he liked her because she had an inner strength and confidence he thought would make her an asset in a household where the mistress was disabled. Mommy and she took to each other immediately, and by now it was impossible for me to think of her as anything less than a member of our family. She was often a second mother to me, ordering me to dress more warmly or eat better. She even had something to say about where I would go and with whom I would go. A mother hen didn't hover over an egg as much as Mrs. Geary hovered over me as I grew up under both her and Mommy's wings.<br><br>"I spent almost as much time and energy as your mother keeping you growing healthy and strong, and I'm not about to see my investment go sour," she told me if I complained. She loved to find words and expressions to avoid expressing her true feelings for me. It was as if she believed that the moment you told someone you loved her, you lost her. I would learn that her own early childhood and teenage years were filled with enough loss to make her think this way.<br><br>Nevertheless, I teased her whenever I could, especially about her endless ongoing romance with Clarence Lynch, the librarian at the municipal library. Like her, he was in his late fifties. They had been seeing each other socially for as long as I could remember.<br><br>Once, when I asked her why she had never married him, her reply was, "Why would I want to ruin a perfectly good relationship?"<br><br>It confused me, of course, and I ran to Mommy with questions. She simply smiled and said, "Summer, not everyone fits so neatly into the little boxes society has created. As long as they're happy, why ask them to change?"<br><br>In Mommy's mind, and I now think mine too, happiness and health were two sides of the same coin, the most important and valuable coin. People who were happy had more hope of being healthy; of course, people who were healthy were happy. Smiles and laughter were the best medications for the illnesses of the spirit.<br><br>No one illustrated this better than Daddy, I thought. He loved Mommy and me so much and was so happy that anyone could see him and feel him radiating with warmth and well-being. He was still a highly respected physical therapist who had assumed his uncle's therapy business and then had created a chain of unique health clubs that combined regular exercise with therapeutic programs. They were known as rejuvenation clubs; their theme was that through exercise and meditation aging could be slowed down and even in some cases reversed. National health and exercise magazines had even featured Daddy in articles. I was very proud of him and so was Mommy.<br><br>Yes, happiness and health were truly the twin sisters my family had adopted to live beside me. They nurtured wisdom and wove a protective wall around our house. Nothing terrible from the outside could hurt us, I thought. But what I also knew was trouble loomed nearby in Uncle Roy's sad and dour world, and it also came riding into our fortress in the form of a Trojan horse named Alison, my Aunt Alison.<br><br>"People who don't like themselves can't like anyone else," Mommy once told me. "Your aunt Alison hates herself. She just doesn't know it or want to know it. I feel more pity for her than I do anger, and you will, too," Mommy predicted.<br><br>Aunt Alison, as well as Grandmother Megan and my stepgrandfather Grant Randolph would all be here today for my birthday party.<br><br>Now in the morning light, I stood by the window and parted the curtains as Mommy had directed. For a moment I thought I was still dreaming. My mouth hung open.<br><br>All of the trees below had been strewn with bright colored ribbons. Many branches had balloons tied to them and they were all dancing to the rhythms of the breezes. Tables covered with green and red and yellow paper tablecloths were all set up on the lawn, and a dance floor was being laid out as I watched. There was even a small stage for musicians.<br><br>Daddy had kept my party arrangements a big secret and had obviously paid people extra to come quietly on the grounds very early in the morning, before the sun was even up, to begin constructing it all.<br><br>"Your father was out there in the dark with a flashlight hanging balloons," Mommy told me.<br><br>"I thought it would be more fun to wake up to it than see it happening days before," he commented from behind.<br><br>I still had trouble finding my voice. Finally, I shook my head and shrieked with joy.<br><br>"It's...beautiful!"<br><br>I rushed into his arms to kiss him and then hugged and kissed Mommy who couldn't stop laughing at my excitement.<br><br>"Is your father crazy or not?"<br><br>"NO!" I cried. "He's wonderful!"<br><br>"You see," Daddy said, "at least I have one woman in this house who sees sense in the things I do."<br><br>"You poor outnumbered man," Mommy teased.<br><br>"Well, you should have heard Mrs. Geary mumbling how it was all too much of this or too much of that and how even happy shocks can be damaging to a young, impressionable spirit."<br><br>"Don't make fun of her," Mommy softly chided.<br><br>"Make fun of her? It's everyone else who's making fun of me. All right. I've got some small matters to look after, such as the parking arrangements. I don't want any of Summer's teenager friends driving their cars over the flowers," Daddy said and left.<br><br>Mommy shook her head and smiled after him. Would I ever find anyone I loved as much and who loved me as much as my parents loved each other? They were living proof that there really was such a thing as soul mates.<br><br>"You'd better get yourself dressed and come down to breakfast," she said turning back to me and starting away.<br><br>"I'm too excited to eat, Mommy."<br><br>"If you don't, Mrs. Geary will single-handedly rip every balloon off every tree and pack up the tables and chairs," she warned. We laughed.<br><br>I hugged her again.<br><br>"Happy, happy birthday, Summer. All your birthdays have been special to me because it was truly a miracle for us to have you," she said softly, "but I know how special this one is for you."<br><br>"Thank you, Mommy."<br><br>I knew how true that was, how difficult my birth was for her and how they had decided not to try to have any more children and test their good luck.<br><br>"I'll see you downstairs," she said and continued to wheel herself out to the chair elevator that would take her down the stairs and to the wheelchair below.<br><br>Never in my life had my mother ever stood on her own beside me. Never had we walked side by side or ran together. Never had we gone strolling through department stores or down streets to window-shop.<br><br>When I was old enough to push her, I thought it was fun. After all, I was a little girl moving my mother along. But somewhere along the way, I turned to watch other mothers and daughters walking through malls, and I looked at Mommy's face and saw the longing and the sadness and no longer did I feel excited or amused by it.<br><br>Was that what growing older meant? I wondered. Losing all your illusions?<br><br>If that was so, why were any of us so happy and so willing to blow out the candles?<br><br>Mrs. Geary milled about the breakfast table longer than she had to, studying me eat as if my consumption of food was part of some important experiment.<br><br>"It's a big day," she preached when I complained about being given too much. "Big days require bigger fortification. I know what's going to happen out there after the festivities start. You won't eat a thing and you'll be going, going, going -- draining and draining that wisp of a willow of a body of yours. That's when sickness comes knocking on the door anticipating a big fat welcome."<br><br>Mommy looked down at her dish of grapefruit slices, hiding her smile.<br><br>"I'm not a wisp of a willow," I protested.<br><br>After all, I was five feet four and nearly one hundred and fifteen pounds. Mommy told me I had a figure like hers once was, although I didn't need to be told. I saw the pictures of her when she was in acting school in London. In all of the photographs, she looked like someone just caught the moment after a wonderful new experience or sight. Her face glowed. There was no better compliment for me than to be compared to Mommy.<br><br>Mrs. Geary always came in the backdoor with her flatteries, especially about my looks and figure.<br><br>"Nature plays a trick on young girls," she informed me. "Before you have a woman's mind, you get a woman's body. It's like putting a diamond necklace around the neck of a four-year-old girl. She has no idea why everyone, especially grownups, are staring at her and she doesn't know yet how to wear it or carry it."<br><br>"Young people are different today," I insisted when she made these speeches at me. "We're far more sophisticated than young people were when you were my age."<br><br>"Oh please," she cried, slapping her hand over her forehead. It was her favorite dramatic gesture. I actually heard the sharp crack of her palm on her skin. "More sophisticated? You have more teenage pregnancies, more children in trouble with drugs, more car accidents, more runaways.<br><br>"When I was your age, the only pregnant girl in the village was a girl raped by her idiot stepbrother."<br><br>"Mommy!" I'd moan in desperation.<br><br>"She's only trying to give you good advice, honey," Mommy said, but she gave Mrs. Geary a look that said, "Enough."<br><br>"I'll eat at my party," I promised. "Daddy's having them make all my favorite things."<br><br>That was a mistake. I knew it the moment the words slipped past my lips. Daddy had hired caterers even though Mrs. Geary said she would prepare all the food. He insisted it was an unfair burden to place on her, but she countered with a surprising admission that preparing the food for my birthday was a special pleasure for her. In the end she was given the responsibility for the birthday cake.<br><br>She grunted at my statement and shook her head. Occasionally, Mrs. Geary would go to a stylist to have her hair cut and shaped, but most of the time, she wore it pinned back in a severe bun. For my party, however, she had surprised us all by having it cut and trimmed in a French style. She had pretty green eyes and a small nose and mouth but a chin that disappeared too quickly. At five feet seven, she was somewhat portly with heavy arms and a robust bosom. She did have a very soft complexion with not even a sign of an impending wrinkle, something she ascribed to keeping makeup and rough soap off her skin.<br><br>"Manufactured food," she muttered with disdain. "It'll have a mass-produced taste."<br><br>"Now, Mrs. Geary," Mommy gently chastised. "You know it's not manufactured food."<br><br>Mrs. Geary bit down on her lower lip, shook her head and went into the kitchen. Mommy smiled at me and said Mrs. Geary would be fine.<br><br>I gobbled down the remainder of my breakfast, too excited to sit a moment longer.<br><br>Daddy was outside working with the grounds people to be sure everything was set up the way he wanted it to be. A little more than two dozen of my girlfriends from the Dogwood School for Girls and almost twenty boys from our sister school, Sweet William, would be attending as well as some of my teachers and, of course, my family and Mrs. Geary's Mr. Lynch.<br><br>I didn't think of myself as going steady with anyone, but I was seeing Chase Ta...</p><h2>Reflections Transmission Lines and Antennas</h2><p>This book looks new.

Kennedy's assassination in 1963. During this period she made two successful appearances on Broadway and won an Oscar for The Diary of Anne Frank . In a prefatory note Winters says she has been somewhat less specific about her amatory exploits in this book, but she still relates affairs with Sterling Hayden, Sean Connery, and Albert Finney, among others, and adds some steamy episodes from her marriage with Tony Franciosa. Much of the fascination of the book stems from observing Winters's naive egocentricity, and wondering what scatterbrained thing she's going to do next. As usual, Winters is not too concerned with accuracy, but the readers who made her previous volume a best seller won't be disappointed by this entertaining follow-up.<br><i>- John Smothers, Monmouth Cty. Lib., Manalapan, N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Resuming her autobiography, following Shelley, Also Known as Shirley , the 60-year-old actress recalls her life after divorce from Vittorio Gassman. Readers will learn about her as a Broadway star fighting her "blond bombshell" image in films during the 1950s and '60s, and about her near-religious devotion to the Actors Studio and to liberal politics. The memoir is largely a gossip-lover's feast. Winters reports on Tony Franciosa, her second husband and his lovers (Ava Gardner, Lauren Bacall, among others), and tells of her own affairs with Sean Connery, Albert Finney et al. Her merrier stories include reminiscences of Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. No celebrity, seemingly, is missing from the autobiography of this Oscar winner (for her role in The Diary of Anne Frank ).

Tour.</p><p>Psychiatrist Peter Kramer's book <i>Listening to Prozac</i> created a sensation when it was released in 1993, and it remains the most fascinating look at the new generation of antidepressants. Kramer found that the changes in brain chemistry brought about by Prozac had a wide variety of effects, often giving users greater feelings of self-worth and confidence, less sensitivity to social rejection, and even a greater willingness to take risks. He cites cases of mildly depressed patients who took the drug and not only felt better but underwent remarkable personality transformations--which he (along with many of the book's readers) found disconcerting, leading him to question whether the medicated or unmedicated version was the person's "real" self. Kramer has been criticized for seeming to advocate Prozac over psychotherapy or as a way of achieving personality changes not directly related to the disease of depression, such as improving one's social confidence or job performance. In fact, he makes no such recommendations; he was simply the first popular writer to suggest that these changes might occur. (He answers those critics in the afterword to this 1997 edition.) For anyone considering taking antidepressants or wanting a better understanding of the effects these drugs are having on our society, <i>Listening to Prozac</i> is a very important book.Peter D. Kramer, M.D., is an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University.</p><h2>Hats In Miniature</h2><p>Elegant top hats and fancy boaters, whimsical berets and sophisticated cloches, sporty caps and something for the chef: these charming miniature hats are perfect for dolls, teddy bears...and just to show off!

Nevertheless the term carries more freight, for it means "the way in which the text has always been and ought to be recited and understood by those who have been closely connected with the texts." The many scholars, all specialists in their fields, who contribute to this expansive volume elucidate the many translations and interpretations of the texts from the formation of the canon, through the Greek and Aramaic translations, the Samaritans, the Rabbis, the New Testament writers, the Latin translations, and the early Christian fathers. <p>From published reviews of the hardcover edition of Mikra: Text, Translation, Reading and Interpretation of the Hebrew Bible in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity </p><p>"A vast amount of important information and useful knowledge has been brought together in this large (but not unreasonably priced) tome. I envy the person who can truly say that he or she has nothing to learn from it. But I doubt whether such a person will easily be found." &#x2014;The Studia Philonica </p><p>"This important work must be commended most heartily. The range of articles is impressive, from 'Writing in ancient Israel and Early Judaism' to 'Old Testament Interpretation in the Writings of the Church Fathers' and the twenty chapters cover the canon, cycles of reading in the synagogue, the ancient versions (Septuagint, Samaritan Targum, Jewish Aramaic translations, Peshitta and Latin translations) and interpretation, authority and use at Qumran and in the apocrypha, Philo, Josephus, and other Hellenistic Jewish authors, rabbinic literature, the Samaritan tradition, Gnostic literature, and the early church. </p><p>"The general theme which controls the approach is 'how did the biblical books develop into Mikra, and how could this unique text give rise to such a wealth of interpretations. . . . This will be one of the standard works of reference, which all decent libraries should possess." &#x2014;The Expository Times </p><p>"In its range of coverage the volume breaks some new ground, for no other work of this nature offers anything really comparable. . . . Not the least important feature of this volume is the fact that it embraces both Jewish and Christian tradition, thus emphasizing the importance of studying these two traditions together, rather than in isolation, as has all too often been the case in the past. As one might expect from such a distinguished team of scholars, the quality of the contributions is generally high, and some are outstanding. . . . All in all, this may be judged an eminently successful and useful volume." &#x2014;Oxford Journals: Journal of Seminary Studies</p></p><p>Martin J.

She and her husband, Earl, live in the mountains of North Carolina.Jackson's 10th entry in the series featuring middle-aged, curmudgeonly reporter Jim Qwilleran pits the independently wealthy citizen of the remote town of Pickax City against malevolent spirits, of either this world or another. Iris Cobb, the resident-curator of the local historical museum, tells Qwill she's hearing ghosts; after she dies of what the coroner says is a heart attack, Qwill and his Siamese cats, Yum Yum and the psychic zany Koko, move in to find out what could have scared her to death. Unearthing old and well-kept secrets in Moose County family histories, Qwill also investigates some newcomers to the area, notably the museum's neighbors down the road at Fugtree Farm, and the deceased's son whose inheritance is considerable. Fans of earlier The Cat Who . . . stories may welcome Qwill's return along with other Pickax regulars such as librarian Polly Duncan and Arch Riker, editor of the weekly Moose County Something , but as a mystery, this busy, superficial and weakly plotted tale is as unsubstantial as any ghost and much less haunting.

H. Elliott, resarched for their A Palace for a King ( LJ 10/15/80) revealed new facts about Velazquez, and became the basis for Brown's latest book. There are gaps in the artist's biography that will probably never be filled, but Brown could make some logical assumptions about the many years Velazquez lived under the patronage of Philip IV of Spain. Brown was able to establish a new chronology for some of the controversial paintings, and he has eliminated a few questionable ones from the artist's oeuvre. This is an important addition to Velazquez studies. It is also a highly readable, excellently illustrated book for laypersons who wish to learn more about this intriguing artist.

Le Guin.</p><p><i>The Avram Davidson Treasury</i> may be the most satisfying short-story collection of the decade. Davidson (1923-1993), one of science fiction and fantasy's greatest writers, was "a master shaper of small stories," writes Alan Dean Foster in his introduction to "Or the Grasses Grow." Foster is joined in introducing the stories by dozens of extraordinary authors, including Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, William Gibson, Poul Anderson, and many others. Davidson was clearly adored, and often emulated, despite his reputation for being somewhat curmudgeonly. His mastery of language was exquisite, and his stories glittered like diamonds. Each of the 38 tales in this collection spanning five decades is a self-contained wonderland. One of the most famous (and most often plagiarized) short stories in science fiction appears here: "Or All the Seas with Oysters," tells of slightly sinister safety pin pupae, coat hanger larvae, and bicycle adults in a world where machines are more than they seem.<p> Of "Dagon," John Clute writes, "It is as vicious as the world of a fish, and wise. It is masterly.... it cannot be read. It can only be re-read." On the surface, this is the story of an American military officer in Peking in 1945, but lurking underneath are ancient gods, Chinese magicians, and the obscene torpor of hell. As Ray Bradbury writes in his afterword, "Many of these stories are complete mysteries, puzzles. Avram Davidson starts us in a fog and lets us orient ourselves slowly.... His knack for a proper pace is that of a true teller of tales." But all of Davidson's stories aren't dark--far from it. He was a satirical genius, able to poke fun at sacred cows and turn a comic phrase with the best of them. Some of these stories will make you laugh out loud.</p><p> To the fan of great literary short fiction: Don't skip over this deeply fulfilling treasury because Avram Davidson was "only" a science fiction author. He's been compared to Rudyard Kipling, Saki, John Collier, and G.K. Chesterton, if you need a literary excuse. </p><p> And to the science fiction or fantasy fan: This amazing and creative Hugo, Edgar, and World Fantasy Award winner, nominated for <i>seven</i> Nebula Awards by his fellow writers, will astound and amaze you. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"Not merely a treasury, it's a genuine treasure. Some of its pages will carry you away to strange seas and shores, others will show you the marvelous within the seemingly ordinary, and just about all of them will take your breath away. But that's what magicians do." --<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><p> "My favorite book of 1998--by far--is <i>The Avram Davidson Treasury</i>. Davidson was beyond question one of the unjustly neglected writers of the twentieth century, an author of immense talent." --Gene Wolfe</p><p> "Davidson had one of the most original imaginations in the history of American SF and fantasy...and he deserves to be enjoyed by generations of ordinary readers rather than left to the dubious mercy of SF academics." --<i>Booklist</i></p><p> "Buy this book. It is aptly named: a treasure." --<i>Interzone</i></p></p><h2>Soldados de Salamina (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>In the final moments of the Spanish Civil War, a writer and founding member of Franco&#39;s Fascist Party is about to be shot, and yet miraculously escapes into the forest.

Yet too often we stop at one point of interest--evangelism, spiritual disciplines, social justice--and go no further. Interweaving stories from a summer vacation, Jerry Sittser shows how our lives can include all God has in mind for us.

Sorcha's daughter Liadan is a gifted seer and healer who thinks, in spite of her visions, that she knows what the future has in store for her--caring for her dying mother and then an alliance marriage to Eamonn. A chance meeting on the road carries her off to care for a dying man--one of the mercenaries of the sinister Painted Man, Eamonn's archenemy and a killer for hire. Liadan discovers that she cannot choose whom she loves and that she and the Painted Man are as bound up in destiny as her mother and father were before her. <p> This is an intelligent historical romance in which the supernatural is a part of the character's everyday lives to an extent that makes it hard to think of the book as specifically a fantasy--these are people to whom the beings of forest speak on a regular basis and to whom sorcery is real. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Juliet Marillier</b> achieved international recognition with the publication of the first two award-winning novels in the <i>Sevenwaters Trilogy</i>, a historical fantasy set in Ireland and Britain in the ninth century, and loosely based on the fairy tale &#x201c;The Six Swans&#x201d;.

Artists' lists shed uncover a host of unbeknownst motivations, attitudes, and opinions about their work and the work of others.

Many of the lists are historically important, throwing a flood of light on a moment, movement, or event; others are private, providing an intimate view of an artist's personal life: Pablo Picasso itemized his recommendations for the Armory Show in 1912; architect Eero Saarinen enumerated the good qualities of the then <em>New York Times</em> art editor and critic Aline Bernstein, his second wife; sculptor Alexander Calder's address book reveals the whos who of the Parisian avant-garde in the early twentieth century. In the hands of their creators, these artifacts become works of art in and of themselves.

Curator Liza Kirwin has gathered from the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art dozens of examples of unremarkable lists made by remarkable men and women. <p>The lists themselves demonstrate clearly that geniuses truly are just like you and me. But it is precisely those actual accomplishments outside of the mundane list-making realm that make these lists worthy of collection, curation, and in the case of this book, further study. We see lists of paintings sold, lists of appointments, lists of books to read and more. Many of the lists give us more than just daily ephemera: we see Pablo Picasso listing his recommendations for the epoch-making Armory Show in 1912, Alexander Calder's address book is a who's who of the Parisian scene when he lived there." --my3books<br><br>"`Lists' is by turns funny, telling and mundane.

Anne Perry was selected by The Times as one of the twentieth century&#39;s &#39;100 Masters of Crime&#39;.Victorian London society is shocked by the bizarre killing of General Thaddeus Carlyon during a dinner party at the elegant home of Maxim and Louisa Furnival. Even more shocking is the admission of Alexandra, the General's wife, that she had murdered him in a jealous rage. Meanwhile, Carlyon's sister Edith is convinced that Alexandra had another motive, one powerful enough to save her from the gallows. She enlists the help of stalwart friend Hester Latterly, who brings into the case famed lawyer Oliver Rathbone and ex-police officer Thomas Monk (The Face of a Stranger, A Dangerous Mourning). Together, they delicately probe the lives of the Carlyon family--Thaddeus's father, a retired colonel; his daughter; forbidding mother Felicia; high-strung daughter Isabella, and young son Cassian. The uncovering of Alexandra's secret is slowed by repetitious interviews, constant underlining of the period social mores, and Monk's tortuous exploration of his own past, lost to amnesia after an accident some time back. But the pace quickens as Alexandra's trial draws near, and the story ends in a courtroom drama loaded with vigor, tension, and poignancy--ample reward for the patient reader. Overall: another winner in this fine series. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, ... of our country by eminent American artists</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;One hundred years ago a two-volume, leather-bound work titled Picturesque America was published in New York. Among the many excellent illustrations in these volumes were forty-nine steel engravings that are classics of nineteenth American illustration. In this book those forty-nine engravings, now hand colored, are reproduced once again. They provide a unique picture of America during the early 1870&#39;s, from the coast of Maine to Florida and along the shores of the Pacific, crisscrossing the whole country in between. The artists include some notable American landscape painters and illustrators of the time: John F. Kensett, Worthington Whittredge, J.W. Casilear, Thomas Moran, Homer Martin, Harry Fenn, J.D. Woodward, Granville Perkins, F.O.C. Darley, and A.C. Warren. As Oliver Jensen, Editor of American Heritage, says in his preface, these artists show America at a time &#39;when cities looked different from each other, the time before cubelike skyscrapers, the time when a Providence or a Cincinnati or a St. Louis took pride in its character and uniqueness....This is not rainy-day America, nor New York of the Bowery, but picturesque America, the wonders and achievements that an optimistic age wished to show as its face to the world.&#39; The great poet and editor William Cullen Bryant brought the original Picturesque America together. He wrote: &#39;It is the purpose of the work to illustrate with greater fullness, and with superior excellence as far as art is concerned, the places which attract curiosity by their interesting associations, and, at the same time, to challenge the admiration of the public for many of the glorious scenes which lie in the by-ways of travel.&#39; One hundred years later the classic engravings from Picturesque America, printed in this book by an advanced color-printing technique undreamed of by the original publisher, will give modern viewers a nostalgic look at the America of that &#39;optimistic age.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>See&#39;s Famous Old Time Candies: A Sweet Story</h2><p>More fun than a box of Butterscotch Lollypops and with stories richer than a &#39;Dark Chocolate Truffle&#39;, &#34;See&#39;s Famous Old Time Candies&#34; is your golden ticket to sneak inside a real candy factory.

He then examines the U.S. government's response to both genocidal campaigns. Of utmost interest here is the evidence he presents that President Eisenhower's secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, and Dulles's brother Allen, director of the CIA, deliberately stymied efforts to bring to justice many German bankers and industrialists involved in the Nazis' extermination-through-labor programs. The study leaves little doubt that many members of Germany's corporate elite not only were aware of the genocidal programs during the war but sponsored innumerable supplementary negelganger , or "side camps," staffed by company employees. Simpson argues that while genocide is still widely practiced today, it is usually tolerated by those who benefit from it through the theft of land and natural resources. The cycle of genocide can be broken, he maintains, through relatively straightforward (though politically difficult) reforms of the international legal system. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this intriguing combination of revisionist history and conspiracy theory that should interest many students of the Cold War, Simpson ( Blowback , Grove, 1988) asserts that genocide has been a common factor in the development of many Western nations, including the United States. He argues that genocide has recurred due to the willingness of monied classes to support amoral governments that work to further their commercial interests. By way of example, he cites both the Turkish slaughter of the Armenians during World War I and the Jewish Holocaust. He faults U.S. diplomats for their role in both tragedies, especially those who aided the escape of Nazi war criminals after World War II. Though well written, Simpson's work suffers from a lack of objectivity and a constant tone of accusation. Some conclusions regarding the origins of the Cold War are highly speculative and are likely to come under serious criticism by many historians.

The action stretches over Wergeland's more than 50-odd years, over many countries and through a wide swath of women and a murder. The novel is presented as the work of an academic turned popular author who has been commissioned to write a Wergeland biography. However, the professor has been stymied by a writer's block that is only lifted when a mysterious stranger with insight about Wergeland appears at his doorstep. Despite the collage of stories, the name-dropping of Norwegian artists and the complex system of symbolism that Kjaerstad creates, the narrative (thanks to Haveland's faultless translation) never feels head-scratchingly Norwegian, and Kjaerstad leaves overly obvious signposts to assure there is no ambiguity about his motifs and meanings. Kjaerstad's reminder that the connections between the stories in a life are as important as the stories themselves yields well-knit&#x2013;together stories, so that a darkly humorous picture of Wergeland's life finally emerges. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Do new readers need to read The Mortal Instruments before they read the new series?<p></p> <b>A:</b> The Infernal Devices take place in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but a hundred and fifty years before the events of the Mortal series. You absolutely don't have to read The Mortal Instruments first; I've gotten very enthusiastic feedback from people who started with <i>Clockwork Angel</i>. However, if you are a fan of the Mortal Instruments, you'll see familiar family names--Lightwood, Wayland--and get to see what the ancestors of the characters you already know were up to in the Victorian age. There is at least one character who crosses over both series: the immortal warlock Magnus Bane. For those familiar with the Mortal books, it should be fun to meet him again; for those who haven't read them, it should be fun to meet him for the first time!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Do you have a favorite character in <i>Clockwork Angel</i>? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Like Tessa, I'm torn between Jem and Will! They were both so wonderfully fun to write. Despite having a close brotherly bond, they're really opposites in personality. Will is a character who hides almost everything about himself; Jem is a character who is almost unendingly open and kind. Of course, when either kind of character reaches their breaking point, you have those moments of high drama and intensity that are catnip to writers!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What characteristic or personality trait does Tessa possess that you most admire? <p></p> <b>A:</b> She is extremely persistent and unwilling to give up. When she's imprisoned, she doesn't stop trying to escape; she never stops trying learn new information; she never stops looking for her brother. She never fades quietly into the background; she plants her feet and asks questions--and gets answers, often from the unlikeliest of sources.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How much research did you do for <i>Clockwork Angel</i>? What was the most interesting thing that you learned?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Starting in January of 2009 I took a six-month period of reading only books written during, or set in, the Victorian era--both fiction and nonfiction. I have an entire bookshelf now dedicated just to Victoriana. I also hired a research assistant who dug through primary source materials to find me letters and diaries written at the time. I was especially keen to find diaries of Americans traveling abroad, since Tessa is an American in London. I wanted to get a sense of what her impression as a foreigner would have been. One of the creepiest things I learned about was Victorian death photos, where they would prop up corpses to seem alive and take photos of them for their loved ones to have as keepsakes.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Which type of character is the most fun for you to write--the hero or the villain? <p></p> <b>A:</b> There's a huge appeal to writing both, but there's something special about creating a really good villain. The villain stands outside society. He or she can say or do anything without fear of what the consequences will be for his/her relationships with the other characters. Sometimes the villain is the only one who can speak a vicious or painful truth and get away with it. <p></p> <br>Cassandra Clare is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of <i>Lord of Shadows</i> and&nbsp;<i>Lady Midnight</i>, as well as the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and Infernal Devices trilogy.

This is a straightforward guide to all things American that explains mannerisms, food choices, attitudes, and a bevy of other idiosyncratic characteristics with plenty of wit. Perfect for novices to the country or Yankees looking for a bit of self-analysis, this is a no-holds-barred look at the red, white, and blue.</p></p><p>"Xenophobia--an irrational fear of foreigners, probably justified, always understandable." <p> "Xenophobe's Guides--an irreverent look at the beliefs and foibles of nations, almost guaranteed to cure Xenophobia." </p><p> The Xenophobe's motto is "Forewarned is forearmed," and this guide series gives travelers to foreign lands as much ammunition as possible. In <i>The Xenophobe's Guide to the Americans</i>, Stephanie Faul (herself an American) takes readers on a perceptive, ironic, frequently hilarious tour of the American psyche, from its basic traits to its attitudes about sex, drugs, and gun control. Discussing the American character, for example, Faul states "Americans believe themselves to be the only nation that is truly capable of winning.... Having God on your side in a fight is good. Having the United States on your side is better. To an American, they're the same thing." On obsessions she writes: "There are a few, a very few things that Americans condemn as being beyond the pale. They include: Growing Old ... Being Fat ... Dying." </p><p> Perhaps Americans themselves are in the best position to appreciate Faul's barbed commentary, but foreign visitors will surely find plenty to inform as well as amuse in this slim volume. American readers, take heart: there are 18 other Xenophobe titles taking equally irreverent potshots at everyone else, from the Australians to the Icelanders.</p>'Winning is central to the American psyche. As American football coach Vince Lombardi put it, "Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing."<br>Virtually every event in American life, from school graduation to marriage to buying an automobile, is structured so that one party wins, or at least comes out looking better than any of the other participants.'<br>Xenophobia is an irrational fear of foreigners, probably justified, always understandable.<br>Xenophobe's Guides - an irreverent look at the beliefs and foibles of nations, almost guaranteed to cure Xenophobia.<br></p><h2>The Nonviolent Atonement</h2><p>This challenging work explores the history of the Christian doctrine of atonement, exposing the intrinsically violent dimensions of the traditional, Anselmian satisfaction atonement view and offering instead a new, thoroughly nonviolent paradigm for understanding atonement based on narrative Christus Victor. <p>The book develops a two-part argument. J. Denny Weaver first develops narrative Christus Victor as a comprehensive, nonviolent atonement motif. The other side of the discussion exposes the assumptions and the accommodation of violence in traditional atonement motifs. </p><p>The first chapter lays out narrative Christus Victor as nonviolent atonement that reflects the entire biblical story, though paying particular attention to Revelation, the Gospels, and Paul. This biblical discussion also touches on the Old Testament story, Hebrew sacrifices, and the book of Hebrews. Following chapters place narrative Christus Victor in conversation with defenders of Anselm and with representatives of black, feminist, and womanist theologies. These discussions expose an accumulation of dimensions of violence in the several forms of satisfaction atonement. </p><p>A final substantive chapter analyzes the inadequacy of all attempts to defend Anselm against the recent challenges raised by feminist and womanist perspectives. This analysis lays bare the violent dimensions of satisfaction atonement, which can be camouflaged but not removed. In light of this discussion, Weaver argues that the view of satisfaction atonement must be abandoned and replaced with narrative Christus Victor as the only thoroughly biblical and thoroughly nonviolent alternative. </p><p>A provocative study that cuts to the very heart of Christian thought, The Nonviolent Atonement will be of interest to scholars, students, and pastors.</p></p><p>Evangelical Christians sing hymns in which blood figures prominently; one in particular is called "Nothing But the Blood." Such Christians may have to change their tune after reading J. Denny Weaver's The Non-Violent Atonement, which proposes that the idea of "satisfaction atonement" must be jettisoned in favor of a nonviolent approach. Jesus' death, says Weaver, was not planned or sanctioned by God the Father; it was the inevitable result of sinful humans taking matters into their own hands. Perhaps the new hymn can be called "Everything But the Blood"? <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Juvie Three</h2><p>Gecko, Terence, and Ajay are serving time in juvenile detention centers until they get a second chance. Douglas Healy, a former juvenile delinquent himself, takes them into his halfway house, hoping to make a difference in their lives. One night there is a scuffle, and Healy is accidentally knocked unconscious. When he awakes in the hospital, he has no memory of them or of the halfway house. Afraid of being sent back to Juvie, the guys hatch a crazy scheme to continue on as if the group leader never left. <br><br>But if the boys are found out, their second chance will be their last.</p><p>Gordon Korman (www.gordonkorman.com) is the number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of more than fifty popular young adult and middle-grade novels, including <i>Schooled</i>, <i>Born to Rock</i>, <i>Son of the Mob</i>, and <i>No More Dead Dogs</i>. He lives on Long Island in New York.Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Terence, Gecko, and Arjay made serious mistakes and wound up doing time in juvenile-detention facilities. Empathetic adult Douglas Healy, a former juvenile offender himself, has secured a grant to operate an experimental halfway house in New York City designed to provide second chances to boys deemed as deserving. The teens accept his offer to become his first reformees, willing to trade their bleak incarceration for a small taste of freedom, even though the bargain entails maintaining academic excellence, therapy, and community service. Though Gecko and Arjay enter into the deal in good faith, Terence seems bound for recidivism. Gecko and Arjay attempt to intercept him one night as he tries to use the fire escape as a means of reconnecting with his newfound, gang-related associates. A scuffle ensues and, when Healy intervenes, he falls to the ground, unconscious but still alive. The boys "borrow" a vehicle and drop him off at a local hospital where he awakens with retrograde amnesia. The teens then face the seemingly impossible task of keeping up appearances while also working behind the scenes at the hospital to ensure that Mr. Healy eventually regains his memory and returns to his post as their overseer. This novel is signature Korman; it is a celebration of good, youthful intentions and a wholesome and fun treatment of what might otherwise be prohibitively gritty issues.

The first nearly cost me my life. The second changed it forever.</p><p>But near-death or life-altering experiences weren&#x2019;t on my mind when I flipped the Open sign to Closed on the front door of Shire Architectural Salvage.</p><p>On this warm August evening, my nerves were shot and my head rattling from an argument I&#x2019;d had hours earlier with my brother-in-law, Zeb. Furious, he&#x2019;d curled calloused fingers into fists, paced, and shouted so loud his voice reverberated down the rows of reclaimed doors, stacks of lumber, stained glass, claw-foot iron tubs, marble mantels, and bins filled with odds and ends.</p><p>&#x201c;Addie, how could you do this to me?&#x201d;</p><p>To calm my racing thoughts, I shifted my focus from invoices to cast-iron keys, antique doorknobs, and back plates assembled by my Aunt Grace during her three decades of salvaging. For years, she&#x2019;d been tossing keys and locks into a big bin, never bothering to sort or catalogue. With the keys, at least, I could transform chaos into order.</p><p>&#x201c;How long have you known she was sick?&#x201d; Zeb shouted.</p><p>&#x201c;I tried to warn you!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t try hard enough!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought she&#x2019;d tell you,&#x201d; I stammered.</p><p>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t tell me shit!&#x201d; Eyes once friendly, burned with scorn.</p><p>Trembling fingers brushed over a large tarnished brass key, three inches long. Its lopsided heart-shaped handle created an ornamental air that set it apart from the other utilitarian keys designed for heavy-duty locks. Where had it been found? Grace never worried about documentation. She simply collected, her aim to keep alive as much history as she could cram into the two-thousand-square-foot warehouse on King Street. For every item here there was a second chance for some kind of life.</p><p>As I closed my fingers around the old key, a heavy energy reverberated through my hand and up my arm. Dust flecks danced like fireflies in light generated by countless rescued crystal chandeliers, copper ship lamps, and dozens of other salvaged fixtures. Images of sky and wide-open seas flashed in my mind. Outside, thunder cracked.</p><p>Breathless, I nearly dropped the key back into the box. For a few long, tense seconds, I stared at the lopsided heart, not quite sure what to do with it. The sound of a car door closing caught my attention and I slid the key in my pocket, determined to ask Grace about it later.</p><p>A heavy August rain pelted hard against the salvage yard&#x2019;s glass window when I heard the hard, fast rapping on the front door. Glancing up, I saw my sister, Janet, standing in the rain, holding up a soggy paper bag. Water dripped from her mascara-smudged eyes, which blinked fast, like windshield wipers. Raindrops flattened her thick blond ponytail and soaked her red sundress.</p><p>My relationship with my older sister was forever contentious. There&#x2019;d never been a time of calm or sisterly love. She was the fun, energetic one, whereas I was the safe, steady one. She made messes. I cleaned them up.</p><p>I&#x2019;d hoped we could find a peaceful middle ground after Janet married Zeb at Christmas and then gave birth to a son, Eric, days after Easter. Healthy, with a lusty cry, the boy inherited his father&#x2019;s dark hair, olive complexion, and long limbs. The day Eric was born, I held him in my arms and, after counting all his fingers and toes, I said a prayer of thanks that he was a boy. He was safe.</p><p>You see, Janet and I come from a long line of women who are cursed.</p><p>No one can pinpoint how far back the curse reaches, but I know for certain that Janet, our mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother were all burdened with the same affliction. Mom&#x2019;s doctor was the first to give it a name. He&#x2019;d called it bipolar with psychosis. Drugs could balance and treat, he&#x2019;d said, and for a time, there&#x2019;d been some hope a modern miracle drug would counteract what centuries of prayers couldn&#x2019;t. The medications did offer brief tastes of normalcy, but neither Mom nor Janet liked the side effects, so neither stayed on their medications long. Calm waters never lasted.</p><p>Whatever hopes I nurtured that day in the nursery quickly crumbled. Janet, under the twin weights of wife and mother, dipped back into depression within weeks. At first, Zeb and his parents attributed Janet&#x2019;s mood to postpartum blues. However, those theories shattered when she quickly soared, like Icarus toward the sun, into mania.</p><p>Janet knocked harder on the door, shifting her stance from side to side. &#x201c;Addie, open up!&#x201d;</p><p>My sensible tennis shoes squeaked on the cement warehouse floor as I crossed the main floor and opened the door. &#x201c;Zeb&#x2019;s looking for you.&#x201d;</p><p>Janet brushed inside quickly, tracking mud on my freshly swept floor, and held up a prized bag from the Union Street Bakery. &#x201c;Happy Birthday, Addie.&#x201d;</p><p>I folded my arms, bracing. &#x201c;Janet, did you hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Zeb is fine. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He looked mad.&#x201d;</p><p>She waved away the comment with long, elegant fingers. &#x201c;You thought I&#x2019;d forget your birthday, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Grinning, she was pleased she&#x2019;d remembered and bought a cake. Details were hard for Janet, just as they were for our mother. Remembering was a prize not to be downplayed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s chocolate. Your favorite.&#x201d;</p><p>My birthday was two weeks ago. &#x201c;I love chocolate.&#x201d;</p><p>Janet meant well, but her illness stole time. She often lost months when the depression hit or the mania whipped up into full swing, her racing mind moving so fast that life zinged past her in a colorful blur.</p><p>Grinning, she fumbled for pockets at her side only to realize she wasn&#x2019;t wearing her coat. &#x201c;I wanted to light a candle for you, and I was careful to put matches in my pocket.&#x201d; Nervous laughter bubbled. &#x201c;Now I just have to find the pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>Accepting the bag, I fished out napkins, a couple of plates, a plastic knife, candles, and matches. Janet would not have remembered this detail. That was someone at the bakery&#x2019;s doing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in the bag.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, great! You can make a wish like you did when you were little.&#x201d;</p><p>I lifted the cake out of the damp, crumpled cake box and set it aside before I scooped up the soggy carton and dropped it in the trash. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you let me light the candles?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can do it.&#x201d; With a trembling hand, Janet settled several candles in the center of the cake. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not such a lost cause after all.&#x201d;</p><p>I wiped the flecks of sticking cardboard from the counter as she dug a match from the small box and struck it. The tip didn&#x2019;t flare or light, and so she attempted a second and then a third match. Finally, Janet handed me the matches. &#x201c;I think they&#x2019;re too wet.&#x201d;</p><p>I removed one from the box. &#x201c;How you been doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Been doing okay. Got new medicine, and I&#x2019;m feeling real good. Life&#x2019;s feeling steady.&#x201d; She tugged the folds of her wet skirt.</p><p>I struck the match again. Too wet to ignite, it snapped in my hand. I chose another and tried again. It failed. &#x201c;Zeb said he hasn&#x2019;t seen you in four days.&#x201d;</p><p>She flinched. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been busy. Lots to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Zeb has him.&#x201d;</p><p>The last match sputtered and finally caught fire. I held the glowing tip to the candle&#x2019;s wick. Slowly, the circle of candles came alive and cast a soft glow over the waves of chocolate. I blew out the match.</p><p>&#x201c;What have you been up to?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>She clapped her hands together. &#x201c;Addie Morgan, today is about your birthday. I want to talk about happy things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How about the demons? Have they been bothering you?&#x201d;</p><p>The demons, the witches, even the lady of the lake, they&#x2019;d all come to see Janet over the years. The apparitions, which the doctors said were caused by a terrible lack of sleep, were rarely kind to my sister. They taunted her. Told her she wasn&#x2019;t good enough and, sometimes, they suggested I was a threat.</p><p>Janet swiped her finger along the rim of the cake, gathered up icing, and licked. &#x201c;So what are you gonna wish for, Addie? What do you want more than anything?&#x201d;</p><p>My wish was simple. I wanted a normal life. One where my sister and I were friends. A world where the demons didn&#x2019;t come around to taunt her. A world without curses. &#x201c;I wish we could be normal.&#x201d;</p><p>Janet smiled as a shadow darkened her gaze. &#x201c;I wish it, too, Addie. And you know what? I think this time I might be able to hold on. I might not fly toward the clouds or fall into the swamp.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then it&#x2019;s the official birthday wish.&#x201d; I blew out the candles, and we both clapped. I laid out the paper plates and with a plastic knife sliced each of us a piece.</p><p>She accepted her plate, jabbed her fork into the cake, moved it around, but didn&#x2019;t eat. &#x201c;This is nice.&#x201d;</p><p>And on the surface, it was kinda normal. A birthday. Two sisters. </p><p>I bit into the cake. Stale and dry&#x2014;she&#x2019;d bought it weeks ago and forgotten about it. Smiling, I chewed and swallowed. Carefully, I stabbed another piece, moved it around but didn&#x2019;t eat it. We sat in silence for a few minutes, both of us pretending to eat the soggy, stale cake.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of meds do the docs have you on, Janet?&#x201d;</p><p>She dragged her fork over her icing. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember the names. But I have all the bottles in my pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the pocket of your jacket?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Her fingers again slid down the sides of her dress and then curled into fists. &#x201c;I forgot. I&#x2019;m not wearing my coat. I must have left it in the car.&#x201d; A shrug of the shoulders reminded me of a twelve-year-old girl, carefree and unworried.</p><p>&#x201c;When are you supposed to take the meds, Janet?&#x201d; Somewhere along the way I became the oldest child. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not for a while. I&#x2019;m fine. You don&#x2019;t need to worry.&#x201d;</p><p>I swirled my fork in a lump of chocolate icing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried. Just wondering when you&#x2019;re due to take the meds.&#x201d;</p><p>She sighed. &#x201c;Not until six o&#x2019;clock tonight. So there. You don&#x2019;t need to worry.&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced at the clock on the wall. &#x201c;Janet, it&#x2019;s after eight.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared blankly at invisible puzzle pieces lying in a jumble. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be after eight, Addie. I left the bakery at four with your cake and came straight here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure you came straight here?&#x201d; Sheila McCrae would not have sold her a stale cake.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t stop at a bar, if that&#x2019;s what you think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think that.&#x201d; The edges of Janet&#x2019;s plateau cracked and crumbled like the dry cake. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you let me call Zeb? He&#x2019;s worried about you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Don&#x2019;t call Zeb.&#x201d; She dragged the tips of her plastic fork against the paper plate until she dug a rut.</p><p>&#x201c;Why not? He&#x2019;s a good guy, Janet. He loves you.&#x201d;</p><p>A deep frown furrowed her brow. &#x201c;You and Zeb think alike. All you two see are my screwups. I&#x2019;m always wrong where you two are concerned.&#x201d;</p><p>This fake normalcy thinned like ice cream on a hot day. Soon it would drip, run, and melt away. &#x201c;Maybe we should go get your medicines. I&#x2019;ll drive you home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t want to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;</p><p>She jabbed agitated fingers through her hair. &#x201c;Because.&#x201d;</p><p>I dropped the fork and knife, no longer able to keep up the pretense that I was enjoying the stale, soggy chocolate mess. &#x201c;Why, Janet?&#x201d;</p><p>She tightened her jaw and moved to slide her hands again into pockets that weren&#x2019;t there.</p><p>I met her gaze and could see the confusion mingling with the frustration. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened? Are you and Zeb having trouble?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No trouble. Not exactly.&#x201d; She fisted her fingers. &#x201c;I moved out. It was all getting too crazy in the apartment. The baby was crying. Zeb was upset and frustrated. I couldn&#x2019;t take it.&#x201d;</p><p>Even Zeb&#x2019;s once-steady demeanor couldn&#x2019;t navigate these waters. &#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a motel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;</p><p>Janet sniffed. &#x201c;I hate it when you judge me. First, you light the candles, and then you ask me about meds, and now you want to know where I&#x2019;m staying. So many questions. You were always like that. Asking questions.&#x201d;</p><p>And with that, the ground under the almost peaceful moment vanished, and we plunged. I collected our dishes and dumped them in the trash. &#x201c;Let me drive you. Is your car parked out front?&#x201d;</p><p>Janet flipped a lock of her wet blond hair out of her eyes. &#x201c;I can drive myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me drive, Janet. The rain is coming down hard, and I know you don&#x2019;t like the rain.&#x201d;</p><p>She turned to the glass storefront window and stared at the pelting rain splashing on King Street and washing into the gutter. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like rain.&#x201d;</p><p>From under the counter, I grabbed my purse. &#x201c;I can drive.&#x201d;</p><p>She moved to the door, opened it an inch, but let it close immediately when the water splashed her face. &#x201c;The demons like the water.&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed my rain jacket, too tired to point out that the demons weren&#x2019;t real, and laid it over her shoulders. &#x201c;Let me have your keys.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re in the car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Down the block.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to the car.&#x201d;</p><p>Cringing, she stared at the rain pelting the windows. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go.&#x201d;</p><p>I held out my hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go together. I&#x2019;ll drive.&#x201d;</p><p>Eyes wide with fear, she shook her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll protect me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>She took my hand. &#x201c;You fix everything, Addie.&#x201d;</p><p>Outside under the awning, I locked the front door and then, hand in hand, we rushed through the rain to the white Volvo sedan. By the time I slid behind the steering wheel, my hair and coat were as soaked as Janet&#x2019;s. Inside the car, the faint scent of old pizza and hamburgers drifted up from a backseat packed full of her clothes, an assortment of groceries, and empty boxes.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember the name of your motel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The blue one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Riverside?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She let her head fall back against the headrest as her gaze drifted out the side window.</p><p>I started the car. The gauge registered a quarter of a tank of gas. It was enough to get us to the motel on Route One and then to the apartment she shared with Zeb.</p><p>Seeing Zeb didn&#x2019;t thrill me.</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen her,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d told him. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;ll be back. She always comes back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Always? How many times has this happened before?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A few times when we were teenagers. I thought she&#x2019;d gotten a handle on it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can forgive her. She&#x2019;s sick. But you, I can never forgive.&#x201d; Anger had radiated from him. &#x201c;You must have thought you&#x2019;d found a real sucker when I came along.&#x201d;</p><p>Headlights cut through the rain as I backed out of the spot. We were on the main road in...</p></p><h2>Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs!: My Adventures in the Alice Cooper Group</h2><p><p>"Before the world heard of KISS, the New York Dolls, Marilyn Manson, or Ozzy Osbourne, there was Alice Cooper, the original shock-rock band." -Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</p><p>As teenagers in Phoenix, Dennis Dunaway, bassist and co-songwriter for the Alice Cooper group, and lead singer Vince Furnier (who would later change his name to Alice Cooper) formed a hard-knuckles band that played prisons, cowboy bars, and teens clubs. Their wild, impossible journey took them from Hollywood to the ferocious Detroit music scene, and along the way they discovered the utterly original performance style and look that would make them the stuff of legend.</p><p>Speaking out for the first time about his adventures in the Alice Cooper group, Dunaway reveals a band that was obsessed with topping themselves, with their increasingly outlandish shows and ever-blackening reputation.

Dennis Dunaway had a front row seat to all the craziness, and lucky for us, came out the other side with his memories intact.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Chris Shiflett, Foo Fighters</i></p><p>&#x201c;Dennis Dunaway stands out as one of the most progressive bassist of the time. His unique sonic vision and absolute brotherhood connection to Glen, Michael, Alice and Neal created a raw, unpretentious, by the seat of your pants sound that captivated and inspired. And what is equally amazing is Dennis's absolutely clear and detailed recollection and articulation of the journey they took.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard McDonald, Vice President of the Fender Musical Corp.</i></p><p>&#x201c;The multi-faceted autobiography, penned with former Rolling Stone staffer Chris Hodenfield, appeals not only to hard core Alice Cooper fans like myself, but to readers with a general interest in the "rock biography" genre, as well as those who enjoy immersing themselves in the twists and turns of a whole-hearted adventure and an enduring love story set primarily in the heady music scene of the 1960s and '70s.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Newcastle Herald (Australia)</i></p><p>&#x201c;An informative, entertaining, and surprisingly cheerful work. The pacing is fast, the chronology is tight, and the balance of personal, professional, and cultural details is spot-on. ... Dunaway's update tone and flair for storytelling lift this work a step above the average musical memoir. Recommended for music historians, children of the 1970s, and, of course, Cooper fans.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p></p><h2>The Tain</h2><p>The <em>T�in B� Cuailnge</em>, center-piece of the eighth-century Ulster cycle of heroic tales, is Ireland's greatest epic.

Who will be the first victim?</p><p>Lois Duncan is an acclaimed suspense author for young adults. She has published nearly 50 books for children, including <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>, which was adapted into a highly-successful horror film, and <em>Who Killed My Daughter?</em>, a non-fiction book about the harrowing experience of her daughter's murder."The meeting will come to order."&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran Schneider raised the small wooden gavel and brought it down upon the tabletop with a sharp click.&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded toward the partially open door.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will somebody pull that closed, please?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Tammy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us all join hands and repeat the club pledge."<br><br>Hands reached out on all sides around the art room table and closed upon other hands, and a chorus of solemn voices rose softly to recite the words:<br><br>"I pledge myself to the spirit of sisterhood--and to warmth of friendship.&nbsp;&nbsp;I promise to do my best--as a member of the Daughters of Eve-- to follow the code of loyalty, love and service--laid out for womankind since time's beginning--and to divulge to no one words spoken in confidence--within this sacred circle."<br><br>There was a moment of silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hands released each other, and there was a shuffle of bodies shifting position to sit back more comfortably in the hard, straight-backed chairs.<br><i>Something is wrong.</i><br><br>Wrong, how?<br><br><i>I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't put my finger on it.</i><br><br>Then it can't be anything very important, can it?<br><br>It was a habit of Tammy Carncross's to have discussions with herself within her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she felt there must really be two parts of her, two distinct personalities, one the thinking part, one going strictly on emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As she sat now, silent, watching the initiation take place, the two voices within her head picked back and forth at each other like bickering children, and Tammy longed to tell them, "Hush.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trying to enjoy the ceremony."<br><br>The shades at the art-room windows had been drawn, and three white candles had been lighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before them, Fran had placed an open Bible from which she read aloud:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"And Ruth said, 'Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee:&nbsp;&nbsp;for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God."<br><br>It was a moving ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three new members stood with bent heads, and the light from the candles flickered softly upon their faces and threw leaping shadows on the far wall.<br><br>"Such is the spirit of sisterhood--"<br><br><i>Something is wrong.</i><br><br>You have no reason for thinking that.<br><br><i>I have this feeling--</i><br><br>What could it be--?<br><br>And then she saw it, thick and dark, dripping from one of the candles like melted wax.&nbsp;&nbsp;The word flashed through her mind like a high-pitched scream--BLOOD!<br><br>Could nobody else see it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps they simply did not want to see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Recipes from Paradise: Life &amp; Food on the Italian Riviera</h2><p>This collection of recipes introduces the cuisine of Liguria. The nutritional balance of the diet includes an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables, fish and seafood, low fat cheeses, grains, nuts, olive oil, wine and fragrant herbs.</p><p>Fred Plotkin brings together passion and scholarship, poetry, history, and vivid images of Liguria in <i>Recipes from Paradise</i>, a meticulous and loving record of the region known as the Italian Riviera. Literate and richly written, even florid at times, it documents the interplay of land and sea elemental to Ligurian life in fascinating detail. The alluring, authentic recipes include Stuffed Basil Leaves, Chestnut Gnocchi, and Polenta Incatenata, made with beans, cabbage, and potatoes. Ingredient lists give measures by weight (ounces), volume (cups), and grams, and oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Centigrade. Some may find this thoroughness distracting, but it makes the book useful to anyone anywhere. More challenging than the careful measurements is the windy narrative form Plotkin employs in the steps for making the dishes; with so many words to wade through, the style may make finding your place difficult. Italophiles and cookbook literati, however, will not care about Plotkin's verbosity as they are blissfully transported and enlightened by the recipes and descriptions.Fred Plotkin is author of several acclaimed books on Italy as well as writing for the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Food &amp; Wine, Travel &amp; Leisure and Eating Well as well as various Italian publications.

The book is also about the butterflies themselves--for it is only by understanding what butterflies are that we can be effective in providing for them. Finally, this publication is about using our knowledge of butterflies and plants to design a butterfly garden. Property owners throughout Florida can use this book to create their own butterfly gardens using the plants native to their region of the state, and these gardeners, entrusted with the welfare of their butterflies, will form a network of environmental stewards that will help balance whatever impacts the future holds in store for Florida.</p><p>Dr. Craig Huegel is an environmental consultant with degrees in zoology and wildlife ecology.

Other pages were thin and desiccated, positively yellow from age, and crackled alarmingly as Van Richten turned them over. There were no ornate illuminations, no fussy borders, only lines of plain text in hard black ink.

No table of contents, but from the dates it looked to be some kind of history.<br><br>He turned to the first page and read:<br><br><i>I, Strahd, Lord of Barovia, well aware certain events of my reign have been desperately misunderstood by those who are better at garbling history than recording it, hereby set down an exact record of those events, that the truth may at last be known . . . .</i><br><br>He caught his breath.

It was a summer that marked the beginning of a sports rivalry unequaled in the annals of athletic competition. The awesome New York Yankees and the indomitable Boston Red Sox were fighting for supremacy of baseball's American League and an aging Joe DiMaggio and a brash, headstrong hitting phenomenon named Ted Williams led their respective teams in a classic pennant duel of almost mythic proportions--one that would be decided in an explosive head-to-head confrontation on the last day of the season...</p><p>With incredible skill, passion and insight, Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Halberstam returns us to that miraculous summer... and to a glorious time when the dreams of a now almost for gotten America rested on the crack of a bat.</p></p><p>With the airwaves saturated with so much sporting choice, it&#39;s hard to imagine how, not that long ago, baseball so completely dominated the landscape and captured imaginations. Given the 1949 season that veteran journalist David Halberstam meticulously recreates, maybe it&#39;s not so hard after all. It was a season of great public and personal drama for the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, with the conflict finally resolving itself in a Yankee pennant following a head-to-head showdown on the final day of the season. Each team was led by a star of the highest magnitude: Joe DiMaggio spurred the Yankees despite missing half the season with a foot injury; Ted Williams virtually carried the Sox on his back, missing an unprecedented third Triple Crown by mere decimal points on his batting average. Halberstam focuses much of his narrative on the trials of these two individual sporting giants, adding fine supporting performances by Yogi Berra, Ellis Kinder, Dom DiMaggio, even restaurateur Toots Shoor. Both on and off the field, Halberstam beautifully captures the ethos of a more innocent game that no longer exists, played by heroes far more driven by their pride than by their salaries.<p>David Halberstam was one of America's most distinguished journalists and historians. He covered the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement and reported for the <em>New York Times</em> on the war in Vietnam. The author of fifteen bestsellers, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam reporting. He was killed in a car accident on April 23, 2007, while on his way to an interview for what was to be his next book. </p></p><h2>Hypnotic Investigation of Psychodynamic Processes: The Collected Papers of Milton H. Erickson on Hypnosis</h2><p>Volume 3 includes a general historical survey of hypnotism and its approaches to the unconscious through psychodynamic processes of amnesia, literalness, automatic writing and drawing, mental mechanics, dual personality and experimental neuroses.</p><p></p><h2>The Crosswinds of Freedom: The American Experiment Vol.3</h2><p>A winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award analyzes the history of the U.S. for the past 55 years</p><p>Immensely readable, epic in scope yet intimately personal in detail, this sweeping 864-page history of the United States extends from FDR's nomination to the presidency in 1932 to the election of George Bush. Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Burns sees the U.S. as a nation of hazy, undefined ends and shaky, pluralistic means. He admires Roosevelt but criticizes the New Deal because it "failed to fashion an effective economic strategy and stick with it." With 1950s' affluence, he notes, came widespread escapism, intertwining of government and the press, McCarthyism, conformity, compartmentalized work. Burns portrays JFK and LBJ as men who ultimately failed to respond to the cries for freedom emanating from the Third World. He is brief and equivocal on Reagan's rightist counterrevolution, though he recognizes Reagan's mandate to throw liberal elements out of the Republican Party and consolidate conservative power. Chapters broadly delineate the civil rights, feminist and student movements, Vietnam, cultural and technological ferment. This is the final volume of Burns's trilogy which includes The Vineyard of Liberty and The Workshop of Democracy. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The boundaries of this final book in Burns's lively history of the United States--the presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan--frequently overlap with the many books written by Burns, the political scientist on his way to becoming a distinguished commentator on our recent leaders and institutions. The result is both strength and weakness. Strength, in that his political analyses and asides on the varying meanings of freedom are very good indeed. Weakness, in that his original works are necessarily richer statements than a survey can be, and in that his treatment of social and cultural matters is overmatched. Even so, his project is unquestionably a fine achievement. This book, which follows The Vineyard of Liberty ( LJ 12/15/81) and The Workshop of Democracy ( LJ 8/85) will be all but universally acquired by libraries.<br><i>- Robert F. Nardini, N.

Atlantic salmon flies differ from most trout flies in that they aren't intended to imitate insects: rather, they are larger, more colorful, glitzier, unspecified representations that attract the "king of game fish" almost by daring to be miniature objets d'art . The color photographs are exquisite, and the essays by flytyers from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan are both informational and inspirational. A materials list for tying each fly follows the essays. This is highly recommended for libraries with regional interest or large angling collections.<br><i>- Will Hepfer, SUNY at Buffalo Libs.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Dunham's second anthology surpasses her handsome The Art of the Trout Fly in format and text (also price), while falling a little short of the inspired photographic stylings that were the charm of the earlier volume. In fly-tying, recently evolved from a sweet utility into true craft, no patterns demand more skill than the exotic, beautifully intricate, traditional salmon flies. The 23 tyers here, from North America, Europe and Japan, speak about their favorite patterns in various tones of angling rapture, but words, even good yarns, never suffice in fishing. Clayton's photographs of these colorful deceptions, ingeniously displayed, best explain the persisting allure of the gloriously extravagant flies. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Big Book of Scrap Quilts</h2><p>Book by L.

He lives in Orem, Utah, with his wife, Dawn, and four young children.<p>1</p><p>Mrs. Anderson was dead.</p><p>Nothing flashy, just old age&#x2014;she went to bed one night and never woke up. They say it was a peaceful, dignified way to die, which I suppose is technically true, but the three days it took for someone to realize they hadn&#x2019;t seen her in a while removed most of the dignity from the situation. Her daughter eventually dropped by to check on her and found her corpse three days rotted and stinking like roadkill. And the worst part isn&#x2019;t the rotting, it&#x2019;s the three days&#x2014;three whole days before anyone cared enough to say, "Wait, where&#x2019;s that old lady that lives down by the canal?" There&#x2019;s not a lot of dignity in that.</p><p>But peaceful? Certainly. She died quietly in her sleep on August thirtieth, according to the coroner, which means she died two days before the something tore Jeb Jolley&#x2019;s insides out and left him in a puddle behind the laundromat. We didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but that made Mrs. Anderson the last person in Clayton County to die of natural causes for almost six months. The Clayton Killer got the rest.</p><p>Well, most of them. All but one.</p><p>We got Mrs. Anderson&#x2019;s body on Saturday, September Second, after the coroner was done with it&#x2014;or, I guess I should say that my mom and Aunt Margaret got the body, not me. They&#x2019;re the ones who run the mortuary; I&#x2019;m only fifteen. I&#x2019;d been in town most of the day, watching the police clean up the mess with Jeb, and came back just as the sun was beginning to go down. I slipped in the back just in case my mom was up front. I didn&#x2019;t really want to see her.</p><p>No one was in the back yet, just me and Mrs. Anderson&#x2019;s corpse. It was lying perfectly still on the table, under a blue sheet. It smelled like rotten meat and bug spray, and the lone ventilator fan buzzing loudly overhead wasn&#x2019;t doing much to help. I washed my hands quietly in the sink, wondering how long I had, and gently touched the body. Old skin was my favorite&#x2014;dry and wrinkled, with a texture like antique paper. The coroner hadn&#x2019;t done much to clean up the body, probably because they were busy with Jeb, but the smell told me that at least they&#x2019;d thought to kill the bugs. After three days in end-of-summer heat, there had probably been a lot of them.</p><p>A woman swung open the door from the front end of the mortuary and came in, looking like a surgeon in her green scrubs and mask. I froze, thinking it was my mother, but the woman just glanced at me and walked to a counter.</p><p>"Hi John," she said, collecting some sterile rags. It wasn&#x2019;t my mom at all, it was her sister Margaret&#x2014;they were twins, and when their faces were masked I could barely tell the difference. Margaret&#x2019;s voice was a little lighter, though, a little more . . . energetic. I figured it was because she&#x2019;d never been married.</p><p>"Hi Margaret." I took a step back.</p><p>"Ron&#x2019;s getting lazier," she said, picking up a squirt bottle of Dis-Spray. "He didn&#x2019;t even clean her, just declared natural causes and shipped her over. Mrs. Anderson deserves better than this." She turned to look at me. "You just gonna stand there, or are you gonna help me?"</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>"Wash up."</p><p>I rolled up my sleeves eagerly and went back to the sink.</p><p>"Honestly," she went on, "I don&#x2019;t even know what they do over there at the coroner&#x2019;s office. It&#x2019;s not like they&#x2019;re busy&#x2014;we can barely stay in business here."</p><p>"Jeb Jolley died," I said, drying my hands. "They found him this morning behind the Wash-n-Dry."</p><p>"The mechanic?" asked Margaret, her voice dropping lower. "That&#x2019;s terrible. He&#x2019;s younger than I am. What happened?"</p><p>"Murdered," I said, and pulled a mask and apron from a hook on the wall. "They thought maybe it was a wild dog, but his guts were kind of in a pile."</p><p>"That&#x2019;s terrible," Margaret said again.</p><p>"Well you&#x2019;re the one worried about going out of business," I said. "Two bodies in one weekend is money in the bank."</p><p>"Don&#x2019;t even joke like that, John," she said, looking at me sternly. "Death is a sad thing, even when it pays your mortgage. You ready?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Hold her arm out."</p><p>I grabbed the body&#x2019;s right arm and pulled it straight. Rigor mortis makes a body so stiff you can barely move it, but it only lasts about a day and a half and this one had been dead so long the muscles had all relaxed again. Though the skin was papery, the flesh underneath was soft, like dough. Margaret sprayed the arm with disinfectant and began wiping it gently with a cloth.</p><p>Even when the coroner does his job and cleans the body, we always wash it ourselves before we start. Embalming&#x2019;s a long pro cess, with a lot of very precise work, and you need a clean slate to start with.</p><p>"It stinks pretty bad," I said.</p><p>"She."</p><p>"She stinks pretty bad," I said. Mom and Margaret were adamant that we be respectful to the deceased, but it seemed a little late at this stage. It wasn&#x2019;t a person anymore, it was just a body. A thing.</p><p>"She does smell," said Margaret. "Poor woman. I wish someone had found her sooner." She looked up at the ventilator fan buzzing behind its grate in the ceiling. "Let&#x2019;s hope the motor doesn&#x2019;t burn out on us to night." Margaret said the same thing before every embalming, like a sacred chant. The fan continued creaking overhead.</p><p>"Leg," she said. I moved down to the body&#x2019;s foot and pulled the leg straight while Margaret sprayed it. "Turn your head." I kept my gloved hands on the foot and turned to stare at the wall while Margaret lifted up the sheet to wash the upper thighs. "One good thing that came of this, though," she said, "is that you can bet every widow in the county got a visit today, or is going to get one tomorrow. Everyone who hears about Mrs. Anderson is going to go straight to their own mother, just to make sure. Other leg."</p><p>I wanted to say something about how everyone who heard about Jeb would go straight to their auto mechanic, but Margaret never appreciated jokes like that.</p><p>We moved around the body, leg to arm, arm to torso, torso to head, until the whole thing was scrubbed and disinfected. The room smelled like death and soap. Margaret tossed the rags in the laundry bin and started gathering the real embalming supplies.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been helping Mom and Margaret at the mortuary since I was a little boy, back before Dad left. My first job had been cleaning up the chapel: picking up programs, dumping out ash trays, vacuuming the floor, and other odd jobs that a six-year-old could do unassisted. I got bigger jobs as I grew older, but I didn&#x2019;t get to help with the really cool stuff&#x2014;embalming&#x2014;until I was twelve. Embalming was like . . . I don&#x2019;t know how to describe it. It was like playing with a giant doll, dressing it and bathing it and opening it up to see what was inside. I watched Mom once when I was eight, peeking in through the door to see what the big secret was. When I cut open my teddy bear the next week, I don&#x2019;t think she made the connection.</p><p>Margaret handed me a wad of cotton, and I held it at the ready while she packed small tufts carefully under the body&#x2019;s eyelids. The eyes were beginning to recede, deflating as they lost moisture, and cotton helped keep the right shape for the viewing. It helped keep the eyelids closed as well, but Margaret always added a bit of sealing cream, just in case, to keep the moisture in and the lid closed.</p><p>"Get me the needle gun, will you John?" she asked, and I hurried to put down the cotton and grab the gun from a metal table by the wall. The gun is a long metal tube with two fingerholds on the side, like a hypodermic syringe.</p><p>"Can I do it this time?"</p><p>"Sure," she said, pulling back the body&#x2019;s cheek and upper lip. "Right here."</p><p>I placed the gun gently up against the gums and squeezed, embedding a small needle into the bone. The teeth were long and yellow. We added one more needle to the lower jaw and threaded a wire through them both, then twisted it tight to keep the mouth closed. Margaret smeared sealing cream on a small plastic support, like the peel of an orange wedge, and placed it inside the mouth to hold everything closed.</p><p>Once the face was taken care of we arranged the body carefully, straightening the legs and folding the arms across the chest in the classic "I&#x2019;m dead" pose. Once the formaldehyde gets into the muscles, they seize up and go rigid. You have to set the features first thing, so the family doesn&#x2019;t have a misshapen corpse at the viewing.</p><p>"Hold her head," said Margaret, and I obediently put a hand on each side of the corpse&#x2019;s head to keep it steady. Margaret probed with her fingers a bit, just above the right collarbone, and then sliced a long, shallow line in the hollow of the old woman&#x2019;s neck. It&#x2019;s almost bloodless when you cut a corpse. Because the heart&#x2019;s not pumping, there&#x2019;s no blood pressure, and gravity pulls all the blood down into the body&#x2019;s back. Because this one had been dead longer than usual, the chest was limp and empty while the back was nearly purple, like a giant bruise. Margaret reached into the hole with a small metal hook and pulled out two big veins&#x2014;well, technically an artery and a vein&#x2014;and looped a string around each one. They were purple and slick, two dark loops that pulled out of the body a few inches, and then slipped back in. Margaret turned to prepare the pump.</p><p>Most people don&#x2019;t realize how many different chemicals embalmers use, but the first thing that catches your eye is not how many there are, but how many different colors they are. Each bottle&#x2014;the formaldehyde, the anticoagulants, the cauter-ants, the germicides, the conditioners, and others&#x2014;has its own bright color, like fruit juice. The row of embalming fluids looks like the syrup flavors at a sno-cone stand. Margaret chose her chemicals carefully, like she was choosing ingredients for a soup. Not every body needed every chemical, and figuring out the right recipe for a given corpse was as much an art as a science. While she worked on that, I let go of the head and picked up the scalpel. They didn&#x2019;t always let me make incisions, but if I did it while they weren&#x2019;t watching, I could usually get away with it. I was good at it, too, which helped.</p><p>The artery Margaret had pulled out would be used to pump the body full of the chemical cocktail she was making; as they filled the body, the old fluids, like blood and water, would be pushed out the exposed vein and into a drain tube, and from there into the floor. I had been surprised to find out that it all just goes into the sewer system, but really&#x2014;where else would it go? It&#x2019;s no worse than anything else down there. I held the artery steadily and cut slowly across it, careful not to sever it completely. When the hole was ready, I grabbed the canula&#x2014;a curved metal tube&#x2014;and slipped the narrow end into the opening. The artery was rubbery, like a thin hose, and covered with tiny fibers of muscle and capillary. I laid the metal tube gently on the chest and made a similar cut in the vein, this time inserting a drain pipe, which connected to a long coil of clear plastic tubing that snaked down into a drain in the floor. I cinched tight the strings Margaret had looped around each vein, sealing them shut.</p><p>"That looks good," said Margaret, pushing the pump over to the table. It was on wheels to keep it out of the way, but now it took its place of honor in the center of the room while Margaret connected the main hose to the canula I&#x2019;d placed in the artery. She studied the seal briefly, nodded at me in approval, and poured the first chemical&#x2014;a bright orange anticoagulant to break up clots&#x2014;into the tank on top of the pump. She pushed a button and the pump jerked sleepily to life, syncopated like a real heartbeat, and she watched it carefully while she fiddled with the knobs that controlled pressure and speed. The pressure in the body normalized quickly, and soon dark, thick blood was disappearing into the sewer.</p><p>"How&#x2019;s school?" Margaret asked, peeling off a rubber glove to scratch her head.</p><p>"It&#x2019;s only been a couple of days," I said. "Not a lot happens in the first week."</p><p>"It&#x2019;s the first week of high school, though," said Margaret. "That&#x2019;s pretty exciting, isn&#x2019;t it?"</p><p>"Not especially," I said.</p><p>The anticoagulant was almost gone, so Margaret poured a bright blue conditioner into the pump to help get the blood vessels ready for the formaldehyde. She sat down. "Meet any new friends?"</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "A whole new school moved into town over the summer, so miraculously I&#x2019;m not stuck with the same people I&#x2019;ve known since kindergarten. And of course, they all wanted to make friends with the weird kid. It was pretty sweet."</p><p>"You shouldn&#x2019;t make fun of yourself like that," she said.</p><p>"Actually, I was making fun of you."</p><p>"You shouldn&#x2019;t do that either," said Margaret, and I could tell by her eyes that she was grinning slightly. She stood back up to add more chemicals to the pump. Now that the first two chemicals were on their way through the body, she began mixing the true embalming fluid&#x2014;a moisturizer and a water softener to keep the tissues from swelling, preservatives and germicides to keep the body in good condition (well, as good as it could be at this point), and dye to give it a rosy, lifelike glow. The key to it all, of course, is formaldehyde, a strong poison that kills everything in the body, hardens the muscles, pickles the organs, and does all of the actual "embalming." Margaret added a hefty dose of formaldehyde, followed by thick green perfume to cover the pungent aroma. The pump tank was a swirly pot of brightly colored goop, like the slush machine at a gas station. Margaret clamped down the lid and ushered me out the back door; the fan wasn&#x2019;t good enough to risk being in the room with that much formaldehyde. It was fully dark outside now, and the town had gone almost silent. I sat on the back step while Margaret leaned against the wall, watching through the open door in case anything went wrong.</p><p>"Do you have any homework yet?" she asked.</p><p>"I have to read the introductions of most of my textbooks over the weekend, which of course everybody always does, and I have to write an essay for my history class."</p><p>Margaret looked at me, trying to be nonchalant, but her lips were pressed tightly together and she started blinking. I knew from long association that this meant something was bothering her.</p><p>"Did they assign a topic?" she asked.</p><p>I kept my face impassive. "Major figures of American history."</p><p>"So . . . George Washington? Or maybe Lincoln."</p><p>"I already wrote it."</p><p>"That&#x2019;s great," she said, not really meaning it. She paused a moment longer, then dropped her pretense. "Do I have to guess, or are you going to tell me which of your psychopaths you wrote it on?"</p><p>"They&#x2019;re not &#x2018;my&#x2019; psychopaths."</p><p>"John . . ."</p><p>"Dennis Rader," I said, looking out at the street. "They just caught him a few years ago, so I thought it had a nice &#x2018;current events&#x2019; angle."</p><p>"John, Dennis Rader is the BTK killer. He&#x2019;s a murderer. They asked for a great figure, not a&#x2014;"</p><p>"The teacher asked for a major figure, not a great one, so bad guys count," I said. "He even suggested John Wilkes Booth as one of the options."</p><p>"There&#x2019;s a big difference between a political assassin and a serial killer."</p><p>"I know," I said, looking back at her. "That&#x2019;s why I wrote it."</p><p>"You&#x2019;re a really smart kid," said Margaret, "and I mean that. You&#x2019;re probably the only student that&#x2019;s already finished with the essay. But you can&#x2019;t . . . it&#x2019;s not normal, John. I was really hoping you&#x2019;d grow out of this obsession with murderers."</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from I Am Not A Serial Killer by Dan Wells.<br>Copyright 2009 by Dan Wells.<br>Published in April 2010 by Tom Doherty Associates.<br>All rights reserved.

In this magisterial work he examines the plots of films, opera libretti and the contemporary novel and short story. Underlying the stories he examines are Seven Basic Plots: rags to riches; the quest; voyage and return; the hero as monster; rebirth and so on. Booker shows that the images and stories serve a far deeper and more significant purpose in our lives than we have realised. In the definition of these basic plots, Booker shows us we are entering a realm in which the recognition of the plots proves only to be the gateway. We are in fact uncovering a kind of hidden universal language: a nucleus of situations and figures which are the very stuff from which stories are made. With Booker&#39;s exploration, there is literally no story in the world which cannot be seen in a new light: we have come to the heart of what stories are about and why we tell them. Here, Christopher Booker moves on from some of the themes he outlined in his hugely bestselling book The Neophiliacs. Seven Basic Plots is unquestionably his most important book to date.</p><p>As a noted commentator on the political, social and psychological history of our time, Christopher Booker has in recent years, through his weekly <em>Sunday Telegraph</em> column, become the most conspicuous 'global warming sceptic' in the British press. He has based his view on exhaustive research into the scientific evidence for and against the theory of 'man-made climate change'.<br><br>His professional interest in this issue grew out of research for his previous book <em>Scared To Death</em>, co-written with Dr Richard North, a study of the 'scare phenomenon' which has been such a prominent feature of Western life in recent decades. Booker's other recent books have included <em>The Seven Basic Plots</em>, a best-selling analysis of why we tell stories which has established itself as a standard text (also published by <em>Continuum</em>). He has been an author and journalist for nearly 50 years, and was the founding editor of the satirical magazine <em>Private Eye</em>."...It's a tribute to the ease and fluency of his writing that at no point does it seem impenetrable or unwelcoming....full marks to Christopher Booker for recognising that genre fiction (detective stories, horror stories, romances) can be written about in the same breath, as it were, as the great masterpieces of literature." &#x2014;Adele Geras, Times Educational Supplement (UK), November 2004<br><br>"...Scholarly but very readable....His book is a fascinating one...." &#x2014;Leicester Mercury (UK) November 2004<br><br>"...the achievement is monumental and a tribute to the passion with which he [Booker] has pursued his interest in fiction and in story-telling...a compelling read." &#x2014;Wells Journal (UK) November 2004<br><br>"...This is a work of voracious reading and unstoppable enthusiasm" &#x2014;John Mullan, Evening Standard (UK) November 22, 2004<br><br>"Booker`s knowledge and understanding of imaginative literature isunrivalled, his essays on the great authors both illuminating andstimulating. This is a truly important book, an acolade often bestowed andrarely desrved in our modern age" -Dame Beryl Bainbridge, author of Every Man for Himself and winner of the Whitbred Novel Award<br><br>'This book...has mind-expanding properties. Not only for anyone interested in literature, but also for those fascinated by wider questions of how human beings organise their societies and explain the outside world to their inmost selves, it is fascinating.'Katherine Sale, Financial Times (UK), October 22, 2004<br><br>'This is the most extraordinary, exhilarating book. It always seemed to me that 'the story' was God's way of giving meaning to crude creation. Booker now interprets the mind of God, and analyses not just the novel - which will never to me be quite the same again - but puts the narrative of contemporary human affairs into a new perspective. If it took its author a lifetime to write, one can only feel gratitude that he did it.'Fay Weldon, novelist<br><br>'An enormous piece of work, not really one book at all but at least three ...nothing less than the story of all stories. And an extraordinary tale it is ... Booker ranges over vast tracts of literature, drawing together the plots of everything from Beowulf to Bond, from Sophocles to soap opera, from Homer to Homer Simpson, to show the underlying parallels in stories from what appear to be the most disparate sources. If stories are about "what happens next", this book sets out to show that the answer is always "the same things", then to explain why. I found it absolutely fascinating.'Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye<br><br>'This is literally an incomparable book, because there is nothing to compare it with. It goes to the heart of man's cultural evolution through the stories we have told since storytelling began. It illuminates our nature, our beliefs and our collective emotions by shining a bright light on them from a completely new angle. Original, profound, fascinating - and on top of it all, a really good read.'Sir Antony Jay, co-author of Yes, Minister<br><br>'I have been quite bowled over by Christopher Booker's new book. It is so well planned with an excellent beginning and the contrasts and comparisons throughout are highly entertaining as well as informative and most original - and always extremely readable.'John Bayley</p><h2>The Best American Sports Writing 2015</h2><p><b>The latest addition to the acclaimed series showcasing the best sports writing from the past year</b><br><br> For twenty-five years, <i>The Best American Sports Writing</i> has built a solid reputation by showcasing the greatest sports journalism of the past year, culled from hundreds of national, regional, and specialty print and digital publications.

But I think I was named in part after the irrelephant, which is a large white or pink animal with a very long nose that is incapable of making any difference no matter how hard it tries. My name is a curse, because everyone ignored me, thinking I was irrelevant, when I'm actually a very pretty girl, as you can see. So I tried going by my initial instead. That made me I Kandy. Then everyone looked at me. In fact they looked too much; their eyes wandered to places that, well, made me blush. Wherever I go, now, those Wandering Eyes pursue me. I almost feel them peering down inside my halter and up under my skirt, trying to pull off my clothing. They don't care about me at all, just how I look, or how certain parts of me look, and their cynosure makes me feel dirty there. This is no good either.&#x201d;<br><br>She paused again. Now there was a stronger ripple, almost in the shape of an eye. The well was definitely looking. She hoped it was orienting on her face.<br><br>&#x201c;So I'm caught between two extremes: irrelevance, or getting eyed.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe that's my talent; I'm not aware of any other. This ruins my social life. I'm actually a smart girl who would make any man an excellent wife. But no man sees that. No man is interested in my mind or personality, just my whatevers. So here is my wish: I'm board stiff. I want Adventure, Excitement, and Romance.&#x201d;<br><br>Now the ripples made her reflection shimmer. She definitely had the wishing well's attention.<br>&#x201c;I searched all over for a suitable offering,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;It occurred to me that how you look is governed by the sand on your bottom. It is frankly sort of dull. So I found a pretty colored stone that should add interest. Here it is: my offering, and I hope you like it.&#x201d;<br><br>She brought out the stone, which was like a faceted blue diamond, sparkling all over. She dropped it into the well.<br><br>Something happened. A sudden whirlwind surrounded her, lifting her up and ripping off her clothing. She was changing, somehow.

At eighteen he became the youngest officer in the Israeli military, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant commander in charge of naval weapons testing. He was a Mossad case officer from 1984-1986.Intelligence agencies should never try to ban books about themselves. Like Peter Wright's Spycatcher (Penguin USA, 1987), which was suppressed in Britain , this book on Israel's legendary spy organization by a former Mossad katsa or case officer has ended up on the New York Times best seller list. Among the controversial revelations that led Israel to seek a ban (which was quickly overturned in the United States and Canada) is Ostrovsky's charge that the Mossad refused to share knowledge of a planned suicide mission in Beirut, resulting in the deaths of 241 U.S. Marines in 1983.

Aside from being in the right place at the right time--and, of course, mastering your camera--it's equally important to be able to pluck "the moment" out 10, 50, or 100 snaps. Most photography books show us the final result, obscuring the context of the shoot and larger insight into the photographer's design. Steve Crist's<i>The Contact Sheet</i> restores that context, taking over 40 iconic images and restoring them to their original sequences, next to the near-misses and the never-minds (an excellent motivational tool for frustrated photographers, by the way). From Anton Corbijn's Allen Ginsberg, to William Wegman's weimaraners (with Elliott Erwitt's Marilyn and a revealing look at Doisneau's "Le baiser de l'hotel de ville" in between), <i>The Contact Sheet</i> is an unprecedented glimpse into the photographer's craft, and a perfect gift for the photography lover. --<i>Jon Foro</i>Steve Crist has edited and created numerous art and photography books including The Polaroid Book, Marilyn by Andre de Dienes, Jazzlife and Steve McQueen by William Claxton, and The Curse of Lono by Hunter S.

Robert Kammen, Joe Marshall, and Frederick Lefthand have written a more fully rounded history of those battles, melding oral accounts handed down by the Sioux and Crow participants with well researched U.S. Cavalry records. This is a thrilling story, even today, and these writers have breathed new life into a great mystery. SOLDIERS must stand as the definitive story of Custer&#39;s defeat. Finally, we can see how the battles developed from the Native American point of view. This book should be read first by anyone interested in learning what really happened to Custer&#39;s dream of glory.</p><p>Published to coincide with Custer Battlefield National Monument's renaming as Little Big Horn National Monument, this book incorporates Native American ideas about the famous battle as they have been retained in the historical memory of the area's residents. Kammen, a prolific author of fast-paced Western fiction set in Montana and Wyoming ( Montana Rimfire, Zebra, 1991), collaborates with two Native Americans: Joe Marshall, who provided a traditional Sioux perspective, and Fredrick Lefthand, who gives the Crow viewpoint. However, among the many works on Custer and the Little Big Horn, there are better books acknowledging the Native American perspective, most notably Joseph Kossuth Dixon's The Vanishing Race (1913) and Robert Utley's excellent Cavalier in Buckskin (Univ. of Oklahoma, 1988). Kammen's style is better suited to Western fiction. Not recommended. --Margaret W. Norton, Fenwick H.S.

If Thomas Merton had been a monk and not a writer, we would never have heard of him.&#x201d;<br><br>So begins acclaimed author Mary Gordon in this probing, candid exploration of the man who became the face and voice of mid-twentieth-century American Catholicism. Approaching Merton &#x201c;writer to writer,&#x201d; Gordon illuminates his life and work through his letters, journals, autobiography, and fiction. Pope Francis has celebrated Merton as &#x201c;a man of dialogue,&#x201d; and here Gordon shows that the dialogue was as much internal as external&#x2014;an unending conversation, and at times a heated conflict, between Merton the monk and Merton the writer. <br><br>Rich with excerpts from Merton&#x2019;s own writing, <i>On Thomas Merton </i>produces an intimate portrait of a man who &#x201c;lived life in all its imperfectability, reaching toward it in exaltation, pulling back in anguish, but insisting on the primacy of his praise as a man of God.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary Gordon is the author of eight novels, including <i>There Your Heart Lies</i>, <i>The Company of Women</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Love of My Youth</i>; six works of nonfiction, including <i>Joan of Arc: A Life</i> and the memoirs&nbsp;<i>The Shadow Man </i>and&nbsp;<i>Circling My Mother</i>; and three collections of short fiction, including&nbsp;<i>The Stories of Mary Gordon</i>, which was awarded the Story Prize. She has received many other honors, including a Lila Wallace&#x2013;Reader&#x2019;s Digest Writers&#x2019; Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and an Academy Award for Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She teaches at Barnard College and lives in New York City.&#x201c;Ardent, heartfelt, headlong: with these words Mary Gordon lovingly penetrates to the core of Thomas Merton&#x2019;s ongoing importance, but the same words apply to her achievement. Gordon is the ideal reader of Merton, matching his intelligence, irony, and authentic feel for the world beyond words. Her book brings his books back to life, and belongs with them from now on.&#x201d;&#x2014;James Carroll, author of <i>Constantine&#x2019;s Sword </i>and <i>The Cloister<br><br></i>&#x201c;Only a writer as talented as Mary Gordon could have written about a writer as talented as Thomas Merton.

Drawings by the Author<br></p><p>Although he was born and raised in Little Rock, Donald Harington spent nearly all of his early summers in the Ozark mountain hamlet of Drakes Creek, his mother&#39;s hometown, where his grandparents operated the general store and post office. There, before he lost his hearing to meningitis at the age of twelve, he listened carefully to the vanishing Ozark folk language and the old tales told by storytellers. His academic career was in art and art history because, although determined to become a novelist (he wrote his first one at six), he felt that his ultimate teaching vocation should not interfere with his writing. He has taught art history at a variety of colleges in New York, New England, South Dakota and finally at his alma mater, the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, where he has been lecturing for fifteen years in the same room where he first took courses in art history. He lives in Fayetteville with his wife Kim. His first novel, THE CHERRY PIT, about Little Rock, was published by Random House in 1965, and since then he has published twelve other novels, most all of them set in the Ozark hamlet of his creation, Stay More, based loosely upon Drakes Creek. These include LIGHTNING BUG, SOME OTHER PLACE. THE RIGHT PLACE., THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ARKANSAS OZARKS, THE CHOIRING OF THE TREES, and, most recently, THIRTEEN ALBATROSSES. He has also written books about artists. He won the Porter Prize in 1987, the Heasley Prize at Lyon College in 1998, was inducted into the Arkansas Writers&#39; Hall of Fame in 1999 and that same year won the Arkansas Fiction Award of Arkansas Library Association. John Guilds in his anthology, ARKANSAS, ARKANSAS, wrote, &#34;if Miller Williams ranks as the greatest poet born, bred, nurtured, and still living in Arkansas, Donald Harington is by the same standards Arkansas&#39;s greatest novelist.&#34; The Winter 2002 SOUTHERN QUARTERLY is a &#34;Donald Harington Special Issue&#34; with tributes from fellow novelists, scholarly essays, interviews, and a selection of his forty-year correspondence with William Styron.Harington follows the fortunes of the brothers IngledewJacob and Noah and their descendants, founders and proud citizens of Stay More, Ark., for 150 years.

The Knights Templar of the Middle East breaks new ground in this well-tilled sphere and is guaranteed to stir more fires of controversy than any other book to date on Freemasonry and Templars. Prince Michael writes with sterling scholarship, making full use of his access to libraries of the secret orders of which he is a member. The book delves deep to examine the true roots of this worldwide society, revealing both historical events from Europe to the Middle East and the author&#39;s own deeply personal, perilous journey to research and expose this hidden history. Going against the accepted history of the Freemason society as evolved from a remnant of Knights Templar who settled in Scotland, The Knights Templar of the Middle East takes readers much farther back to the true historical biblical land, based in Western Arabia rather than Palestine. The true secret of the Inner Circle of the Order of the Templars was such that, had they revealed it, the knowledge would have rocked the cradle of Christian and Judaic beliefs.</p><p>HRH Prince Michael is a Grand Master of the Order of the Knights Templar of St. Anthony and a Scottish Freemason. His first book, The Forgotten Monarchy of Scotland, was a bestseller in Scotland and the UK. In 1992, Prince Michael was elected president of the European Council of Princes.

Following the exploits of his best-loved characters -- Dennis Savage, J. (who was once Little Kiwi), Carlo, the slowly maturing 'elf-child' Cosgrove, and narrator Bud - as he lays bare the changed emotional landscape of the city within a city that is Gay Manhattan. Blending the comic, the sexy, the tragic, and the at once idealistic and realistic, these stories are Ethan Mordden at his very best.<br><br></p><p><br>Ethan Mordden's writing has appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Baum Bugle</i>, and the late and unlamented <i>Christopher Street</i>. He has recently completed a six-volume history of the American musical, from the 1920s through the 1970s, capping this with <i>The Happiest Corpse I've Ever Seen: The Last 25 Years of the Broadway Musical</i>. He lives in Manhattan.<br>Ethan Mordden may be joshing us again. He claims that How's Your Romance? is the last installment of "Buddies," his cycle of linked stories about a group of gay male New Yorkers. The previous volumes are I've a Feeling We're Not in Kansas Anymore (1985), Buddies (1986), Everybody Loves You (1988), and Some Men Are Lookers (1997). We've heard this from Mordden before; the man is a tease, and How's Your Romance? doesn't close on a note of finality. At any rate, its publication offers an opportunity to look back on a work that has kept pace with its subject: modern American gay life. <p>These new stories contain more episodes in the lives of its regulars: Bud, the narrator, a writer with an intimidating knowledge of opera, classic movies and Broadway musicals (and whose identification with Mordden himself couldn't be clearer -- sometimes the nickname gets shelved, and he goes by "Ethan"); Cosgrove, Bud's live-in boyfriend; Dennis Savage, a schoolteacher; Virgil, Dennis Savage's former live-in boyfriend, also known as Little Kiwi or J.; and Carlo, a hunky pal of them all. That Dennis Savage (he always gets his full name) and Bud live in the same building allows for constant drop-ins, � la "Seinfeld" or "Friends," and the series can be described as a highly literate, roundly raunchy sitcom. </p><p>Speaking of friends, there's a moment in Buddies (volume two of the series, that is) when Bud states his theme succinctly: "What unites us all, surely, is brotherhood, a sense that our friendships are historic, designed to hold Stonewall [the 1969 riots that kindled gay liberation] together. It is not rebellious sex habits that define us so much as the rebel coterie itself, the act of not bothering to adjust to gringo procedures. It is friendship that sustained us, supported our survival." </p><p>What he might have added is that, in many cases throughout the series, friendship emerges from an affair or even a one-night stand. Lovers come and go, but friends can be perennial, and they, more than couples or families, are what Mordden celebrates and sings. Thus, when J. left Dennis Savage for an outsider a book or two ago, Dennis Savage took it better than the group as a whole.</p><p>Cosgrove in particular went into a tailspin, which is only natural since he and Little Kiwi (as he then was) were always teaming up to put on a show or play a game or launch a ditsy enterprise, like a gay Lucy and Ethel. At the beginning of Some Men Are Lookers, for example, their latest rage was the Commercial Game, which involved watching TV with the sound off and improvising their own texts for the ads. "All car pitches are for Subaru," Bud explains. "All horror movies are for something Cosgrove has entitled Exorcis -- 'You can run, you can hide,' he gloats, 'but it's coming to get you' -- and all cereal spots are for Sugar Boy Pops," which is a not-so-veiled epithet for the players themselves.</p><p>Often when new characters are introduced, they fail to live up to righteous gay standards. In a story called "The Hunt for Red October" (also from Some Men Are Lookers), the offender is Roy, who takes a tape-measure approach to male desirability. When Dennis Savage questions Roy's maturity, Roy gets cynical: "Oh, please. There are only two kinds of gays -- size queens and liars." Dennis Savage retorts, "I'm not a liar, and I'm not a size queen -- although I can be impressed." Roy does not become part of the group.</p><p>On the other hand, the ability to amuse -- whether intentionally or not -- is a big plus. J. has it, as he proves with such fractured clich�s as, "If he's mean to you, just throw him away like tomorrow's sawdust." Same with Cosgrove, though his antics are often non-verbal, such as freezing when Bud's answering machine flips on to screen an incoming call, as if moving would alert the caller to Cosgrove's presence. </p><p>How's Your Romance? proffers two theories as to why J. dumped Dennis Savage. One is that over time, J. grew tired of "being cute and unpredictable and conceiving outlandish projects and making sure everyone found him seraphic." J. himself gives Cosgrove the other explanation: "It was almost entirely because [Dennis Savage] made me have a day job, while you got to sleep late and goof around." (Both are probably true.) Otherwise, these stories tend to dwell less on the old group than on a new, younger one composed of Bud's knockout cousin Ken and his Chelsea muscleboy acolytes, "the Kens." Which strikes me as rather a copout. Bud and Dennis Savage must be well into their fifties by now, but there's hardly a word here about how, as aging members of the Stonewall generation, they cope with the withering of beauty and the onset of physical decline. Bud and his buddies may not like to face such facts, but Mordden ought to be braver. Or is the prominence of Ken and the Kens in this book a tacit judgment by Bud that older gay men aren't worth studying? </p><p>How's Your Romance? is a passable addition to what is overall an entertaining, informative and stylish series. Here's hoping it's only the latest volume, not the last. </p><p>Reviewed by Dennis Drabelle <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Church served in the Senate for 14 years (1957-1981), during which time he was active in the debates over civil rights, the Vietnam War (which he articulately opposed), presidential power, and FBI and CIA power. Includes photos. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>An exhaustive, nicely done biography of the late Idaho senator Frank Church, whose four terms (1957-81) ran from the beginning of the Cold War to the post-Vietnam era. A liberal Democrat who ``resembled a rejuvenated New Dealer,'' Church represented an extremely conservative and Republican state. Ashby (History/Washington State Univ.) and journalist Gramer note that even though he developed considerable national clout, Church was always fighting for survival back home. Elected at age 32, he was one of the youngest senators in US history. His role in passing the 1957 Civil Rights Act, by supporting the removal of a section deemed too liberal by some, gave early notice that Church would ``balance his idealistic impulses with political realities.'' But this ``tendency to compromise,'' write Ashby and Gramer, ``also provided the basis for criticism that followed him'' throughout his career. The keynote speaker at the 1960 Democratic National Convention, Church helped usher in the ``new liberalism'' of the Kennedy administration. His ardent sponsorship of wilderness- preservation legislation alienated Idaho big business, and his emerging role as a Senate ``dove'' during the 1960s spurred a right-wing backlash that culminated in a nearly successful recall movement in 1967. He survived, according to the authors, by politicking against gun-control legislation in his state. He defied his own party's president on the war in Southeast Asia, and it was his bipartisan Cooper-Church amendment that--on paper, at least- -prohibited the use of ground troops in Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. He achieved national recognition when he chaired committees investigating the CIA and ITT's manipulation of the Chilean elections and, later, looking into the ``profits from Pentagon-sponsored export sales'' garnered by weapons manufacturers Lockheed and Northrop. While overtly pro-Church, this is nonetheless a fine examination of the fate of New Deal liberalism, its role in the Cold War, and its failure to stand up to what the authors call the ``growing power of the New Right.'' -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now reissued with stunning new jacket and edited contents. At the climax of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, the population of the Northern Hemisphere risked extinction. Two hundred years earlier, Cuba - whose position in the Caribbean was the military key to the New World - was similarly the storm centre of the Seven Years War between England, France and Spain. Hugh Thomas&#39;s book explores the whole sweep of Cuban history from the English capture of Havana in 1762 through the years of Spanish and United States domination down to the twentieth century and the extraordinary revolution of Fidel Castro. &#39;So much that seems obscure in the present Cuban scene&#39;, Hugh Thomas writes, &#39;becomes more comprehensible if set against the experiences of the previous four or five generations.&#39; Accordingly, throughout this two hundred year period the author relates the political, economic and social events of Cuba; in particular he sets Cuba&#39;s greatest crop, sugar in the context of slavery and the Atlantic slave trade and the development of Cuba&#39;s relations with the United States and the other states of Latin America. Cuba marries Hugh Thomas&#39;s unique skills as an historian with an intricate and absorbing subject.</p><p>Hugh Thomas is the author of, among other books, The Spanish Civil War; The Conquest of Mexico; An Unfinished History of the World and, most recently, The Slave Trade.

The straightforward design takes pertinent quotations from Adams's writings on wilderness conservation and interleaves them with informal subject groupings of photographs: Yosemite, ocean beaches, Yellowstone, Hawaii, trees, plants, and flowers. Turnage's warm introduction helps readers grasp in concrete terms the early shaping of Adams's commitment to nature conservation, his prodigious output and accomplishments, his visual legacy, and the success of his mission, spanning six decades, to preserve America's wild places. The quality of the large reproductions, from prints prepared by Adams's associate John Sexton, could not be finer. Recommended for photography, geography, and environmental science collections.

A contributing editor at <i>Vanity Fair</i> since 1996, she previously worked at <i>Time</i> and <i>The New York Times, </i>where she was a cultural news reporter. In 2012, Smith was the recipient of the Washington Irving Medal for Literary Excellence. She is the mother of three children and lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband, Stephen G. Smith.Critics always claimed that former CBS Chairman William S. Paley's As it Happened ( LJ 3/15/79) wasn't how it happened. Here Smith, author of Up the Tube: Prime-Time TV and the Silverman Years ( LJ 7/81), offers an objective discussion of the creation of the "Tiffany Network." Paley, Smith asserts, was often resistant to change; newsman Edward R. Murrow and "power behind the throne" Frank Stanton may have molded the media company more than Paley did. Still, Smith also pays tribute to Paley's shrewd, strong personality, even though it sometimes resulted in megalomania and compulsive womanizing. With its mix of business reportage and gossip about a "brilliant circle" that included wife Babe, Truman Capote, Slim Keith, and David O. Selznick, this book should have wide appeal in public libraries.

Foreman&#39;s biography of the great-great-great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales presents a picture of political and sexual intrigue and shows that Georgiana was a gambler, a drug addict, an adultress and the darling of the common people.</p><p>Georgiana Spencer was, in a sense, an 18th-century It Girl. She came from one of England's richest and most landed families (the late Princess Diana was a Spencer too) and married into another. She was beautiful, sensitive, and extravagant--drugs, drink, high-profile love affairs, and even gambling counted among her favorite leisure-time activities. Nonetheless, she quickly moved from a world dominated by social parties to one focused on political parties. The duchess was an intimate of ministers and princes, and she canvassed assiduously for the Whig cause, most famously in the Westminster election of 1784. By turns she was caricatured and fawned on by the press, and she provided the inspiration for the character of Lady Teazle in Richard Sheridan's famous play <i>The School for Scandal</i>. But her weaknesses marked the last part of her life. By 1784, for one, Georgiana owed "many, many, many thousands," and her creditors dogged her until her death. <p> Biographer Amanda Foreman describes astutely the mess that surrounded the personal relationships of the aristocratic subculture (Georgiana and the duke engaged for many years in a m�nage � trois with Lady Elizabeth Fraser, who inveigled her way into the duke's bed and the duchess's heart). Foreman is, by her own admission, a little in love with her subject, which can lead to occasional lapses of perspective, but generally it adds zest to a narrative built on, rather than burdened by, scholarship, that is at once accessible and learned. An impressive debut, in every sense. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br>"Georgiana bursts from the pages of Amanda Foreman's dazzling biography like the force of nature she undoubtedly was--passionate, political, addicted to gambling, and drunk on life.

Only one man knows the truth. Marley&#39;s confidante and manager Don Taylor, tells the real story behind Marley.</p><p>Marred by meandering narration and boundless self-aggrandizement, this memoir by Bob Marley's manager does little to demythologize the late, great reggae superstar. Though Taylor dutifully addresses Marley's life before their association, this is an edited version of transcripts of his taped memoirs, and Taylor comes across as more interested in hearing himself talk. Readers will learn more about Taylor's childhood in Kingston's Trench Town and his rise in the music business than about Marley's childhood and early career. Taylor makes much of the deal-brokering that goes on in the recording industry and of his proclivity for it: "Thanks to my shrewd management and teamwork, Bob's stature was growing" is just one example. Taylor does capture Bob Marley's navigation of Jamaica's incendiary political landscape in the 1970s, and the story of the attempt on Marley's life is well told (Taylor was seriously injured in the attempt). But Taylor's efforts to offer insight into Marley's personal life would be laughable if they weren't so embarrassingly bad, as when, in describing Bob and Rita Marley tending to their dreadlocks, Taylor opines, "To see them lighting up their spliffs during this combing ritual was a beautiful sight." Get the boxed set instead. Discography. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Taylor, manager of such acts as Martha and the Vandellas and most recently Soul II Soul, writes about the rise of reggae great Bob Marley (1945-81). After outlining the parallels between his and Marley's youths, Taylor details his experiences as Marley's manager from 1975 to 1981, including the late 1976 assassination attempt on the musician in which Taylor was seriously wounded. Though adding few insights into Marley's music, the author offers an interesting portrayal of Marley, describing him as an ironic figure: a devoted father with an entourage of women; a multi-millionaire who traveled on tour with only a duffel bag of belongings; and a musician who hoped to unite warring political factions into religious unity. He also provides an insider's view of the music business, including cutthroat financial dealings, political machinations, and the Mafia connection.

Reprint.</p><p>Since her debut novel The Country Girls Edna O&#39;Brien has written over twenty works of fiction along with a biography of James Joyce and Lord Byron. She is the recipient of many awards including the Irish Pen Lifetime Achievement Award, the American National Art&#39;s Gold Medal and the Ulysses Medal. Born and raised in the west of Ireland she has lived in London for many years.Irish-born O'Brien (who lives in London and has written emotionally intense, mordantly funny novels and short story collections like A Fanatic Heart, 1984) turns her attention to the continuing troubles in her native land--``a beautiful tragic country to be born into''--contemplating it through the eyes and hearts of a handful of characters entangled in a violent moment. Chief, and perhaps most intriguing, among these is Josie O'Meara, a widow, dessicating in the large West Country farmhouse to which her misogynistic husband brought her as a bride many years before. A stash of IRA guns hidden on the property and an anonymous note left on the doorstep of the Guarda brought about his death, though Josie hardly seems to have mourned, for her life with him was a bitter root. But when late one night her sleep is broken by an intruder who turns out to be an IRA terrorist popularly known as the ``mad beast,'' Josie shocks herself by warming to him, writing in her journal, ``I want before I die to be myself again.'' The captor, named McGreevy, and his increasingly willing hostage talk politics--for instance, how IRA guerillas often ``get the wrong men,'' peaceable, unaligned locals who happen to get in the way of a bullet or bomb blast (this is called ``the Paddy factor'')--and about their own lives. Unaccountably, he opens up, telling her of the wife and baby daughter he lost. Then he disappears to murder an English lord, come to the area to take his boat out on the lake. Josie lies to the authorities when they interrogate her about the fugitive, though they know it and stake out her house, expecting McGreevy to return. When he does, the novel's vicious climax unfolds in a lyric swell, through which a stern note sounds--about how ``the same blood and the same tears drop from the enemy as from the self.'' No answers here, of course, but well worth reading as O'Brien's first concentrated treatment of the troubles--and the pain they visit on the Irish people. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He first wrote these stories to entertain his children, borrowing freely from the worlds of the Pit, and also of the Miwok, Pomo, and Karok. Here are the adventures of Father Bear, Mother Antelope, the little boy Fox, and, of course, Old Man Coyote in a time when people and animals weren't so very far apart. The author's intent was not so much to rer anthropologically faithful translations-though they are here-as to create a magical world fueled by the power of storytelling while avoiding the dangers for the romantic and picturesque. True to the playful and imaginative spirit he portrays, de Angulo mischievously recommends to readers: "When you find yourself searching for some mechanical explanation, if you don't know the answer, invent one. When you pick out some inconsistency or marvelous improbability, satisfy your curiosity like the old Indian folk: 'Well, that's the way they tell that story. I didn't make it up!'" <br></p><p>Jaime de Angulo drew on his forty years among the Pit River tribe of California to create the amalgam of fiction, folklore, tall tales, jokes, ceremonial ritual, and adventure that is Indian Tales.

Natasha and Ava, who is now enrolled in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s training program, are grieving the death of Alex, Natasha's long-lost brother and Ava's boyfriend. When S.H.I.E.L.D.'s network is hacked and a new villain appears with a dangerous mind-control drug, the teens must once again save the world from the Red Room.

He lives in New Jersey. The Crissa Stone novels are in development for a TV series by Showtime.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Four hours after she got off the plane in Detroit, Crissa was parked on a downtown street, watching a rust-eaten Subaru with half a million dollars in the trunk. <br>&#x201c;You sure that&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; she said. <br>Charlie Glass, the one who&#x2019;d brought her into it, said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; and gave her the binoculars. He was behind the wheel, Crissa riding shotgun. They were in a stolen RAV4 with smoked windows, parked two blocks down from the Subaru, on the same side of the street. <br>From behind her, Larry Black said, &#x201c;Taking a chance, aren&#x2019;t they? Leaving it out there like that?&#x201d; <br>Beside him, Cordell, Glass&#x2019;s cousin, and the only one she didn&#x2019;t know, said, &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s got the balls to touch it. Marquis know that.&#x201d; <br>Through the binoculars, she could see the black and red Tigers cap on the rear deck, where Cordell had said it would be. A half block behind the Subaru, on the opposite side of the street, a black Nissan Armada with tinted glass sat at the curb. <br>&#x201c;How many in there?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Three usually,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Sometimes four. Getting sloppy, though. Marquis caught them getting their smoke on in there last month. He rolled up with Damien to check on them. Whole ride smelled of reefer. He had Damien put a beating on them for that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Damien?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;His brother. A couple years younger. He&#x2019;s the muscle.&#x201d; <br>She looked at her watch. Almost five on a Saturday, but only a handful of cars had passed in the half hour they&#x2019;d been here. This was a business area once, sandstone office buildings and a bank, a row of stores. Now the bank was a discount furniture showroom, and most of the storefront windows were plywooded over, or covered by riot gates scrawled with graffiti. A barber pole hung drunkenly beside a doorway, all the glass gone. No one on the street at all. <br>She lowered the binoculars. &#x201c;This is no good. Staying out here too long.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thought you&#x2019;d want to see the setup,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;d know I wasn&#x2019;t lying. This might be the last chance for a while.&#x201d; <br>Fifteen minutes ago, they&#x2019;d watched the Subaru pull up. The driver, a black man with dreadlocks, had gotten out, locked the car, and started walking. A Honda Accord had picked him up a block away and driven off. Almost on cue, the Armada had appeared from a side street, taken up its station. <br>She turned to hand the binoculars to Larry, took a better look at Cordell. Close-trimmed hair, round gold-framed glasses, denim jacket over a tie-dyed Bob Marley T-shirt. He looked like a college student. <br>&#x201c;How often do they switch cars?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Every time,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Different hour, different street. But that Tigers cap is always there. That&#x2019;s how they know.&#x201d; <br>Larry was looking at the Subaru now, resting the binoculars on the seat back. &#x201c;Just the Armada?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t put anyone in one of those stores around there, cut a hole in the plywood, keep a lookout?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Guess he figures with those boys on watch, he doesn&#x2019;t need to,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;They been doing this no sweat for over a month now.&#x201d; <br>Glass looked at her, said, &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; <br>He was tall and dark-skinned, scalp shaved clean. She&#x2019;d worked with him once before, a takeover at a check-cashing store in Pittsburgh two years back. The take had been weak, but he&#x2019;d been solid, dependable. When he&#x2019;d contacted her about possible work in Michigan, she&#x2019;d agreed to fly up, meet with him, take a look. <br>&#x201c;Not sure yet,&#x201d; she said. <br>Larry lowered the binoculars. &#x201c;What do they carry in there?&#x201d; The oldest of them, he was from Kentucky, had a faint accent that drifted in and out. Early fifties, but fit, pale blue eyes, black hair swept back and showing gray. <br>&#x201c;They go heavy,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Shotguns, MP5, an AK maybe. There to scare the gangbangers away, is all. Shit was crazy here the last couple years. Dodge City, for real. Even an OG like Marquis has to watch his back. These young&#x2019;uns don&#x2019;t care who he is.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This Damien,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He ever in there?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, Marquis keeps him close. He&#x2019;s the palace guard. Never strays too far from the king.&#x201d; <br>Larry passed the binoculars back to her. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Seems a little careless, considering the kind of money supposed to be in there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not careless,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Confident.&#x201d; <br>She half-turned in her seat. &#x201c;All these stores out of business?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;The whole block, except for the furniture place.&#x201d; <br>They heard a siren. She saw a blue and white Detroit PD cruiser coming up behind them, rollers flashing. Her stomach tightened. <br>The cruiser went by without slowing, past the Armada, past the Subaru. At the intersection, it braked, then turned left against the light. <br>She exhaled. Larry took out a stick of Juicy Fruit, peeled away the wrapper, folded the gum into his mouth. <br>&#x201c;How do they get the car back?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Same way on the other end,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;They take the money out, put the product in, park the car somewhere, make a call. Marquis sends someone to get it. Then they junk the car afterward. That&#x2019;s why they always use a hooptie.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A what?&#x201d; Larry said. <br>&#x201c;A hooptie. A piece of shit. That way, it&#x2019;s parked there, it doesn&#x2019;t stick out. And nobody drives by, wants to steal it, either.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This the way it always is around here?&#x201d; Larry said. &#x201c;This empty?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;On weekends, yeah,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;During the week, there&#x2019;s more people around. There&#x2019;s some office buildings back that way. But on weekends, or after dark, it&#x2019;s like this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in this town two weeks. It makes the &#x2019;Burgh look like Times Square.&#x201d; <br>She looked up at the buildings, a pale moon already showing in the afternoon sky. In the far distance, half hidden by other buildings, the gleaming glass columns of the Renaissance Center caught the last of the sun off the river. But this block was hard-stone, Depression-era architecture, dates carved into cornerstones. Empty windows, dark doorways. Ghost town. Deadtown. She pictured the vacant spaces inside the buildings, trash-strewn floors, broken glass. <br>&#x201c;How long should we wait?&#x201d; Larry said, and, as if in answer, a dark-blue Camry drove past. It slowed near the Armada, then again near the Subaru, stopped at the intersection. When the light changed, it made a left, the same direction the cruiser had gone. <br>They watched in silence. Two minutes later, a man came around the corner, not hurrying. She raised the binoculars. He was light-skinned, Hispanic, wore an olive-drab army jacket. He crossed the street, unlocked the Subaru, got in. After a moment, dark exhaust coughed from the tailpipe. The car pulled away, made a right at the intersection. The Armada waited, then pulled out after it, made the turn in the Subaru&#x2019;s wake. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re waiting to see if anyone&#x2019;s following,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll stay with it a few blocks, then turn around, go home.&#x201d; <br>The street was empty now. A scrap of newspaper blew across the lanes, flattened against a riot gate. <br>&#x201c;It looks too easy,&#x201d; Larry said. <br>&#x201c;It is easy,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;But it won&#x2019;t be for long. This a temporary thing, with his new connect. They may change it up next time, do something else entirely. But right now, like I said, they sloppy.&#x201d; <br>To Crissa, Glass said, &#x201c;Should we follow them, see where they go?&#x201d; <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;No need. If we do it, we&#x2019;ll do it right here, on the street, before they get moving. Let&#x2019;s sit a few minutes. See if anyone else comes out of the woodwork.&#x201d; <br>The sun was slipping behind the buildings now, the street falling into shadow. <br>&#x201c;Has to be a smarter way to move that much money,&#x201d; Larry said. &#x201c;Out in the open like this, doesn&#x2019;t make much sense.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like I said, it&#x2019;s temporary,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;He heard that was the way Nicky Barnes used to do it, up in Harlem. That&#x2019;s his idol.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nicky Barnes is in prison,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Not anymore,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the program now. He went and testified against all those boys used to work for him, the Council. That was his revenge, because they disrespected him when he was in prison, went behind his back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bullshit,&#x201d; Larry said. &#x201c;A rat&#x2019;s a rat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who does the driving on this end?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;For the drop-off?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just some low-level boys,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Nobody he&#x2019;d miss if they got arrested. Nobody who&#x2019;d know anything worth telling the police, either.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None of them been tempted to just keep driving?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Head south, keep all that cash themselves?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;d do,&#x201d; Larry said. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re too scared,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Marquis would find them sooner or later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tell the story,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;One you told me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Couple years back,&#x201d; Cordell said, &#x201c;a bagman took off with ten grand. Damien tracked him down in Cleveland a month later. Put two in his head, did the girl he was with, too. But first Damien cut off his dick and made him eat it. Just for ten grand. Word got around.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds like street bullshit,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;To keep the troops in line.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Maybe not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How many people know in advance where the drop-off&#x2019;s going to be?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Five, six. Shit needs to get organized, people need to be told what to do, where to be. No way he can keep it a secret.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That five or six includes you, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Has to. I find the drivers, that&#x2019;s my job.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So if his money gets taken, you&#x2019;re a suspect.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Likely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We talked about that,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way around it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be here to find out anyway,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;Soon as we do this&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If we do this,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c; <i>If</i> we do this, I&#x2019;ll be long gone afterward.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about Damien?&#x201d; Larry said. &#x201c;Thought you said if someone ripped him off, they&#x2019;d get found eventually?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Marquis headed for a fall,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a matter of time. His connect got busted a while back, that&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s buying from the Mexicans now, doing these hand-offs. Chances are his old connect is going to roll on him. Marquis an easy target. Word is, DEA been looking at him for a long time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s the next drop-off?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Next week. Don&#x2019;t know what day yet.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s moving that much product?&#x201d; Larry said. &#x201c;Half a mil a week?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s stocking up, in case it goes dry again,&#x201d; Cordell said. &#x201c;He needs to keep the cash coming in. He owes money to the Mexicans, too, for what he already bought on commission. So he&#x2019;s padding the bag a little each week until he&#x2019;s caught up.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Five hundred thousand sounds high,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You see the money before it&#x2019;s packed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nah, they do that up in the office. Behind closed doors. No one in there but Marquis and Damien, and this boy they call Metro that does the counting.&#x201d; <br>She was wondering how much of it was street talk, Glass taken in by Cordell&#x2019;s story. Cordell looked too young, soft, to be in the Game in any real way. But the drop-off and pickup had gone as he said they would. And even a quarter million might make it worth doing. <br>&#x201c;How far in advance do you know the location?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Couple days, maybe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not much time. Who picks the spot?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Marquis talks to the Mexicans. They work it out between them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know how it sounds,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;But Cordell&#x2019;s right. This is sloppy right now, because they&#x2019;re fat and lazy. That&#x2019;ll change. We got a window of time here. They may get their shit squared away at some point in the future. It won&#x2019;t be so easy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Body armor,&#x201d; Larry said. <br>She turned to him. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying. If we do this&#x2014;on the street, like this&#x2014;we need body armor, vests. Any of the rollos in that Armada start popping off at us with that kind of hardware, stoned or not, I want some protection.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; Glass said. &#x201c;I can handle that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You financing?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Much as I need to. I&#x2019;ll take it back off the top.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That a good idea?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You worried I&#x2019;ll want more say in how we do it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Should I be?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. Just thought it would be easier that way, for me to put out the money up front, given the time factor. That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; <br>He was right. And aside from the body armor, they might be able to do it with minimal expense. She was looking at the spot where the Subaru had been parked, thinking it through, considering the angles. <br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Glass said. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re good for now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Drop me back at the hotel. We&#x2019;ll talk tonight. I have some ideas.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You thinking it&#x2019;s doable?&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;At the moment,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just thinking.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good enough for me,&#x201d; Glass said, and started the engine. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Wallace Stroby</p><h2>King Arthur: Tales of the Round Table</h2><p>A facsimile of the edition prepared by Andrew Lang in the early 1900s about King Arthur, his heroic knights and romantic residents of Camelot.</p><p><p>Andrew Lang (March, 31, 1844 July 20, 1912) was a Scottish writer and literary critic who is best known as a collector of folk and fairy tales.

It is our cultures and not our genes that determine which foods we eat, which languages we speak, which people we love and marry, and which people we kill in war. But how did our species develop a mind that is hardwired for culture&#x2015;and why?</p><p>Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel tracks this intriguing question through the last 80,000 years of human evolution, revealing how an innate propensity to contribute and conform to the culture of our birth not only enabled human survival and progress in the past but also continues to influence our behavior today. Shedding light on our species&#x2019; defining attributes&#x2015;from art, morality, and altruism to self-interest, deception, and prejudice&#x2015;<em>Wired for Culture</em> offers surprising new insights into what it means to be human.</p></p><p>Mark Pagel is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Reading. He lives in Oxford, England.*Starred Review* Herbert Spencer got it wrong. True Social Darwinism does not mean ruthlessly inhuman competition. Rather, it means the emergence of cooperation and altruism as vital parts of the astounding set of distinctively human adaptations called culture. Arguing this point, Pagel invokes Richard Dawkins&#x2019; notion of memes as cultural units that compete for survival in social life in the same way genes compete for reproduction in biological life. Readers soon see how the memes that foster trust, division of labor, and intergenerational learning have flourished in small groups of related individuals. But Pagel also limns the dynamics of kin groups in incubating memes for deceit, prejudice, and violent aggression toward out-groups. Yet by ferreting out the hidden implications of game theory, sociolinguistics, and the mnemonics of music, Pagel shows that cosmopolitan civilizations can transcend such destructive impulses and so sustain very large yet harmonious societies. Some readers, to be sure, will resist the explanation of even religious worship and artistic creativity in terms of biological science. But readers of diverse perspectives will recognize the timely wisdom in Pagel&#x2019;s concluding reflections on the challenge humans now face in overcoming deeply ingrained ethnic jealousies by developing much more inclusive new conceptions of culture. --Bryce Christensen</p><h2>Shootout at Gold Creek (Blood Bond)</h2><p>Young Matt Bodine and Sam Two Wolves became blood brothers on the day the rancher's son saved the halfbreed's life, forging a bond no one could ever break.

New York Times bestselling author Neil Gaiman delivers another stunning hardcover graphic novel with longtime collaborator Michael Zulli (Creatures of the Night, The Sandman). This is the first comics adaptation of his popular story &#34;The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch,&#34; which saw print only in the U.K. edition of Gaiman&#39;s award-winning work Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions and was recently interpreted for his Speaking in Tongues CD. The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch is a &#34;mostly true story&#34; that combines the author&#39;s trademark magic realism with Zulli&#39;s sumptuous paintings, and has been newly rewritten for this hardcover. Join a group of friends, with the stern Miss Finch in tow, as they enter musty caverns for a subterranean circus spectacle called &#34;The Theatre of Night&#39;s Dreaming.&#34; Come inside, get out of the pounding rain, and witness this strange world of vampires, ringmasters, illusions and the Cabinet of Wishes Fulfill&#39;d.</p><p><b>Neil Gaiman </b>was born in Hampshire, UK, and now lives in the United States near Minneapolis. As a child he discovered his love of books, reading, and stories, devouring the works of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, James Branch Cabell, Edgar Allan Poe, Michael Moorcock, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, and G. K. Chesterton. A self-described "feral child who was raised in libraries," Gaiman credits librarians with fostering a lifelong love of reading: "I wouldn't be who I am without libraries. I was the sort of kid who devoured books, and my happiest times as a boy were when I persuaded my parents to drop me off in the local library on their way to work, and I spent the day there. I discovered that librarians actually want to help you: They taught me about interlibrary loans."<br><br>Neil Gaiman's work has been honored with many awards internationally, including the Newbery and Carnegie Medals. His books and stories have also been honored with four Hugos, two Nebulas, one World Fantasy Award, four Bram Stoker Awards, six Locus Awards, two British Science Fiction Association Awards, one British Fantasy Award, three Geffens, one International Horror Guild Award, and two Mythopoeic Awards.<br><br><b>Michael Zulli </b>is a comic book artist who has worked on <i>Creatures of the Night, The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch</i>,&nbsp;and<i> The Last Temptation. </i>Zulli is also a very popular wildlife illustrator.Gaiman reenlists the remarkable artist who made Creatures of the Night (2004) so staggeringly beautiful. Here Michael Zulli&nbsp;visualizes a much better story from Smoke and Mirrors (1998),&nbsp;which was excluded from its American edition. In it, a fantasy writer much like Gaiman recalls a strange night in London. Prodded out by an old pal and his wife, he meets their biogeologist acquaintance, Miss Finch, at dinner and goes with them to an odd, animal-free circus performing in the cellars underneath the train tracks near Southwark Cathedral. The audience is ambulatory, passing from one chamber to another to see various ostensibly spooky acts; scientifically skeptical Miss Finch is not amused. In the next-to-last room, Miss Finch is pulled away, stoutly protesting, by a performer who says her most ardent wish&nbsp;will be granted in the ninth room. It is. In his characteristic crisp pen-and-ink and watercolor, Zulli has a field day with the garish, freakish, ultimately animal (after all) circus denizens, and he renders regular London interiors and exteriors as gorgeously fore and aft of the circus sequence. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Information Doesn&#39;t Want to Be Free: Laws for the Internet Age</h2><p>In sharply argued, fast-moving chapters, Cory Doctorow&#x2019;s <i>Information Doesn&#x2019;t Want to Be Free</i> takes on the state of copyright and creative success in the digital age.

Stoichita</b> is professor of modern and contemporary art history at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.&nbsp;In what could be called a meticulous dissection of Robert Louis Stevenson's "I Have a Little Shadow," Stoichita (history of art, Univ. of Fribourg, Switzerland) examines the artistic and intellectual concepts of the "dark spot" and of their effects upon our view of reality. In exhaustive if not exhausting detail, he ranges from Pliny to Plato, from Piaget to photography, from wall painting to Warhol. Black is both the absence of light and all the colors of the rainbow; in comparison, the shadow contains both the reflection of the image and its essential nature. Apart from its philosophical terminology, this is a difficult book; few sentences escape from parenthetical insertion, and one wonders whether this is a reflection of the original or the imposition of the stylistic shadow of the translator. Also, it is surprising that such a scholarly book should lack an index. Still, it seems that what the shadow knows, Stoichita knows as well, and his work will be useful in academic and art libraries collecting for a graduate level.?Paula Frosch, Metropolitan Museum of Art Lib., New York<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The View from Rainshadow Bay (A Lavender Tides Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>Filled with the enticing blend of suspense and romance Coble is known for, &#x201c;devotees of Dani Pettrey, Brenda Novak, and Allison Brennan will find a new favorite here.&#x201d;*</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>After her husband, Jack, dies in a climbing incident, Shauna has only her five-year-old son and her helicopter charter business to live for.

In her twelfth collection, Clifton again showcases her gifts of a musical ear attuned to everyday language, a Zen-like minimalism of form and sentence structure, and keen perception that sees beyond obvious realities to a deeply spiritual realm. From the wreckage of what is lost in life to such forces as cancer and terrorism, to the redemption of what remains, like birth and otherworldly assistance, Clifton's voice speaks truth and sings hope. One can see a bit of Dickinson here, as well as Gwendolyn Brooks. And in the last section of <i>Mercy,</i> "The Message from the Ones" (a kind of angelic channeling), there is poignancy akin to Rilke's <i>Duino Elegies</i>. Clifton is a poet who should attract a diverse audience.

As a hardy, easy care, and potentially long-lived lizard, the leopard gecko is the perfect size, attractive in its velvety skin, and fairly easy to breed. The subject of breeding geckos is covered in multiple chapters in this book led by author and herp expert de Vosjoli, who is joined by gecko specialists Dr. Roger Klingenberg, Ron Tremper, and Dr. Brian Viets, who each contribute special chapters to this up-to-date and authoritative guide. Colorfully illustrated, Leopard Geckos provides excellent general guidelines for keepers who wish to add a gecko to their vivarium and maintain their pet in excellent health and condition. The authors provide an introduction to gecko characteristics including distribution, size, longevity, and growth rate, to help beginners better understand the anatomy and behavior of these fascinating lizards. This Advanced Vivarium Systems title includes information about selecting a healthy leopard gecko, handling, housing needs, water and feeding requirements, and shedding and tail loss. Dr. Klingenberg provides the chapter The Recognition and Treatment of Disease,&#x201d; which covers specific disorders keepers should be aware of. De Vosjoli begins the discussion on breeding leopard geckos, and then is joined by Dr. Viets for a chapter on Incubation Temperature and Hatchling Sex and Pigmentation.&#x201d; Tremper&#x2019;s chapter on Color and Pattern Variations&#x201d; focuses on the genetic aspects of breeding leopard geckos. The book also discusses the African fat-tailed gecko plus other eublepharids, including the African clawed gecko, Japanese leopard gecko, Malaysian cat gecko, and the Central American banded gecko.<br></p><p>These books were the first and are probably still the best available on the husbandry of commonly kept and traded reptiles. They are mandatory readying for most keepers, novice and expert alike. Philippe de Vosjoli can single-handedly claim credit for helping to slash the mortality in reptiles sold through the pet trade by better educating purchasers -- <i>Reptilian Magazine, March 1995</i></p><h2>Dimensions Math Workbook Solutions 7B</h2><p>Detailed solutions to problems in the Dimensions Math Level 7B Student Workbook</p><p></p><h2>The Illustrations of Rockwell Kent: 231 Examples from Books, Magazines and Advertising Art (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p>Rockwell Kent (1882-1971) was probably the most important American book illustrator of the 1920s and '30s. Today there is a revival of interest in his illustrations, and this volume brings together for the first time the best of his illustrations from 24 books, as well as magazine art, bookplates, and advertising material &#x2014; examples in all. Many of his most famous illustrations are included, with several selections each from <i>Candide</i> (1928), <i>Moby Dick</i> (1930), <i>The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer</i> (1930), <i>Salamina</i> (1935), <i>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</i> (1936), and <i>Goethe's Faust</i> (1941), among others. Illustrations for lesser-known works such as <i>A Basket of Poses</i> (1924), <i>Venus and Adonis</i> (1931), and <i>To Thee, America!</i> (1946) are also reproduced. The entire collection is dominated by Kent's highly individual style of formalized realism and by his well-known subject matter &#x2014; heroic, or sensual, male and female figures and dramatic scenes of nature, usually in a far-off wilderness. Concentrating on the exceptional works of the '20s and '30s, the volume does include some early material from 1914 and 1915, and a selection of later work from the 1940s and from <i>Rockwell Kent's Greenland Journal</i> (1963). Fridolf Johnson, for many years editor of <i>The American Artist</i> and a respected designer, has written a new introduction tracing Kent's development as an illustrator, captions for the illustrations, and an annotated bibliography of the works represented. The illustrations have been selected by Fridolf Johnson with the collaboration of John F. H. Gorton, Director, The Rockwell Kent Legacies.</p><p>Regarded as the finest American book illustrator of the 1920s and 30s, Rockwell Kent (1882&#x2013;1971) provided art editions of such novels as <i>Candide, Moby Dick, The Canterbury Tales,</i> and <i>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare,</i> as well as such lesser known works as <i>A Basket of Poses</i> and <i>Venus and Adonis</i>.

These skilfully illustrated girls with their curvaceous forms and inviting lingerie soon overtook America's national dessert, in terms of popularity, and even developed considerable potential as a cultural export during the 1940s. "Never show everything," was always the motto. Smiling prettily at the camera, the models exuded just the right amount of sex appeal without seeming too sophisticated or artful. They were the 'girls next door' whose wholesome attraction soon made one forget the magazines' deliberately trashy presentation. Their rosy complexions and innocent allures still titillate even in an age when far more graphic material is the norm.

Hermann, the manager of a paper mill, has decided that sexual gratification begins at home. Which means Gerti - his wife and property. Gerti is not asked how she feels about the use Hermann puts her to. She is a receptacle into which Hermann pours his juices, nastily, briefly, brutally. The long-suffering and battered Gerti thinks she has found her saviour and love in Michael, a student who rescues her after a day of vigorous use by her husband. But Michael is on his way up the Austrian political ladder, and he is, after all, a man. In Elfriede Jelinek&#39;s mitteleuropa, love is as distant from sex as the Alps are from the sea, and the everyday mechanics of husband, wife, and child become a loveless horror. Both a condemnation of the myth of romantic love and an angry defence of women&#39;s sexuality, Lust is pornography for pessimists. A bestseller throughout Europe, Lust confirms Elfriede Jelinek as the most challenging writer - female or male - in Europe today. It is a dark, dazzling performance.Elfriede Jelinek was born in Austria in 1946 and grew up in Vienna where she attended the famous Music Conservatory. The leading Austrian writer of her generation, she has been awarded the Heinrich Boell Prize for her contribution to German literature.

When declining another dessert or passing on the chocolate chip cookies, I&#x2019;ve long explained it by saying that I have the opposite of a sweet tooth. A salty tooth, if there is such a thing. Any time salt and savory flavorings meet something that&#x2019;s crisp and snackable, I&#x2019;m happy: tortilla chips, nuts, popcorn, crackers, and the most beloved of all, potato chips.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I like to think of this book you&#x2019;re holding as something of a salt-lover&#x2019;s answer to all the cookie and sweet-treat cookbooks that come out each year. It is a book for everyone who has a salty tooth like me.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a kid I&#x2019;d not only snack on potato chips out of the bag but layer some between the peanut butter and jelly on a sandwich for a bit of salty-crunchy je ne sais quoi. It was love at first sight with that amazing invention Jiffy Pop, which enchanted by the sheer drama and magic it brought to the simple task of popping corn.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I even gravitated to what seems an unlikely snack for kids: smoked oysters. Nothing fancy, mind you, just those everyday flat tins of little smoky bivalves crammed into tight quarters. Crackers + smoked oysters = happy, even today. So, I was particularly charmed when attending a dinner in Seattle with New York City chef Gabrielle Hamilton while she was on tour with her book Blood, Bones &amp; Butter. The first course included Triscuits topped with canned sardines and a dab of mustard. It&#x2019;s a standard on the bar menu at her restaurant, Prune, echoing memories of foods that sustained her in her earlier years.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; So I know I&#x2019;m not the only one with a personal, often nostalgic, attachment to salty treats. What I find interesting, though, is that when it comes to homemade snacks of the savory type, there are far fewer recipe resources at hand than there are for sweets. For whatever reason, we&#x2019;re not as accustomed to thinking of salty snacks as a made-from-scratch prospect. Among the first culinary adventures we have in the kitchen as kids is to press a cutter into a sheet of sugar cookie dough, or to stir the walnuts into a bowl of brownie batter. I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I never made rye crackers or savory puff pastry snacks with my mom when I was young. Why is that the case? It&#x2019;s time to stop relegating the task of cooking all our salty treats to commercial producers. Time to make some at home.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#x2019;s clear the American population has a taste for salty snacks. In a retail context, it is a bold and dynamic category to be sure. Just check out the chips/crackers/snack mix aisle at the grocery store. In most stores I visit, salty selections dwarf those for cookies and sweet snacks. Extensive research done by the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade in conjunction with Mintel International (a global market research firm) and SPINS (a company that analyzes the retail marketplace) shows dynamic growth in the sector. The resulting &#x201c;State of the Specialty Food Industry&#x201d; report cites that snack sales across all sectors, from specialty to mainstream, topped $11 billion in 2010, noting that figure as an 11 percent increase from 2008. As Ron Tanner, vice president of communications and education for NASFT, pointed out to me in January 2012, &#x201c;Americans have always loved to snack. As people are getting more health conscious, they&#x2019;re looking to find new options.&#x201d; Companies are responding with an ever-increasing array of selections. He goes on to note that there are ingredients &#x201c;you wouldn&#x2019;t think of&#x2014;seaweed snacks, a lot of root vegetables, lots of international flavors&#x2014;going into snacks these days.&#x201d; In November 2011, the Supermarket News website featured an article called &#x201c;Whole Health: Different Chips,&#x201d; which cited some industry observers estimating that sales of salty snacks could hit $24 billion in a few years&#x2019; time. That&#x2019;s a lot of popcorn and chips! <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, we love our salty snacks. We just don&#x2019;t make them at home all that often. My hope with this book is to inspire more playing around in the kitchen with salty-crunchy treats, the way we so easily gravitate to the kitchen to make a batch of cookies or some other sweet snack.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Modern Snack Evolution</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Television and modern salty snacks grew up together in some ways. As the television set became the centerpiece of most American homes, food selections evolved to keep us from missing a moment of Arthur Godfrey and Hopalong Cassidy right there in our living rooms. After the TV dinners were finished and those folding metal TV trays tucked away, snack food made it easy to enjoy the show and not miss a beat. In the early 1950s, the Frito Kid was among the first snacky icons to charm TV viewers over the airwaves with the idea of a salty snack. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Betty Crocker&#x2019;s Picture Cookbook released in 1950, a recipe for &#x201c;Buttered or Cheese Kix&#x201d; was among the first recipes that bridged breakfast cereal to snack food with little more than Kix tossed with melted butter (and grated Parmesan cheese, if you choose). You can take any vaguely puffy-crunchy cereal, embellish it with kindred ingredients such as pretzel sticks and nuts, toss with a seasoned butter, and bake until toasty. What&#x2019;s not to love? The cereal brand Chex released its namesake original Chex Mix recipe in the early 1950s; other similar snack blends went by the more general &#x201c;TV snack mix&#x201d; or &#x201c;TV mix,&#x201d; or sometimes just &#x201c;Party Mix.&#x201d; My snackable tribute to that legacy is on page 114.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the decades, salty snack selections have evolved demonstrably, from Chex Mix and Fritos to lentil chips and Peruvian potato chips. The diversity of prospects when it comes to salty-crunchy offerings helps fuel that growth: the endless potential chip flavorings (from spicy Thai to malt vinegar), the different grains and flours that can be employed (chickpeas, green peas, black beans), the expansion to other chipable foods (sweet potatoes, taro, kale). <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A big driver in recent salty developments is growing consumer interest in snacking without guilt and nibbling something tasty regardless of dietary restrictions or recommendations. Producers new and old, large and small are revisiting, refreshing, reinventing the realm of salty snacks and looking at them from every angle to suit every type of eater. It&#x2019;s why we see snack companies going all-natural with new products, forgoing lab-created flavoring and artificial coloring for natural flavorings and vegetable juices, touting whole grains, and even going gluten-free. You&#x2019;ll be ahead of the game when you&#x2019;re making these snacks from scratch at home. In your own kitchen, you&#x2019;ve got control over the type and quality of ingredients you use. Whether the recipe you pick is retro-style or new-fangled, indulgent or wholesome, your reward is not only fresh and natural snacks but also snacks that are customized to suit your mood, your personality, and your palate. <br><br><b> The Best Crackers</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are a number of other cracker recipes in this book, and I think they&#x2019;re all great, of course. But I call this one &#x201c;the best&#x201d; because it&#x2019;s one of those recipes that should be in the standard repertoire of any snack-lover. The cracker has a really great texture: firm but not too hard, crisp but not too brittle. It holds up well to anything you may want to top it with, from cheese to chopped chicken livers. And it makes for a perfect blank slate for whatever embellishment suits your mood and what&#x2019;s on hand in your kitchen, whether you&#x2019;re adding fresh chopped herbs to the dough or sprinkling the crackers with a few different types of salts. For a seedy version of the crackers, consider topping them with some of the three-seed mixture used on the breadsticks on page 60.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I like to go with a slow rise for the yeast overnight in the refrigerator, rather than just setting the dough in a warm place and rising for an hour or so. The cool temperature slows down the yeast&#x2019;s activity, resulting in a more flavorful dough and one with a more distinctive texture. If time is of the essence though, you can simply let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk and proceed as noted. <br> &nbsp;<br> Makes 5 to 6 dozen crackers<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; teaspoon kosher salt or flaky or coarse <br> sea salt, plus more for sprinkling<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; 1/2&nbsp;&nbsp; cup warm (105� to 110�F) water<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; tablespoons olive oil<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finishing salt (see box)<br> &nbsp;<br>Stir together the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center, pour the warm water into the well, and sprinkle the yeast over, stirring it in gently. Let sit until the yeast is frothy, about 5 minutes. Gently stir to start blending the wet and dry ingredients, drizzle the olive oil over, and continue stirring until a cohesive dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for a few minutes until smooth and satiny. Return the dough to the bowl, cover well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24 hours.<br><br> Preheat the oven to 375�F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.<br><br> Turn the dough out onto the counter, punch it down, and cut the dough into quarters. Use a pasta machine (see page 12) or rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/16 inch thick, dusting lightly with flour as needed. Lightly brush the surface of the dough evenly with water, then sprinkle your choice of finishing salt over the surface. Use a dough docker (see page 9) or the tines of a fork to evenly prick the dough all over.<br><br> With the rolling blade of a pizza cutter or pastry wheel (plain or fluted), cut the dough into roughly 21/2 by 11/2-inch pieces (or whatever size and shape you would like). Arrange the dough pieces on the baking sheets; they can be snug but should not touch. Continue with the remaining dough portions. When <br> 1 baking sheet is filled, bake until the crackers are lightly but evenly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Some crackers around the edges of the baking sheet may be done sooner than those in the center; transfer them to a wire rack to cool and continue baking the rest for a minute or two longer. <br><br> Repeat until all the crackers have been formed and baked, filling one sheet while another is baking. Ideally the baking sheets should cool off before new crackers are added.<br><br> When all the crackers have cooled, arrange them in a basket or bowl for serving, or store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Finishing Salt</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If yours is like most kitchens today, you don&#x2019;t have just a standard box of table salt in the cupboard. Likely there&#x2019;s some kosher or sea salt somewhere, probably a specialty salt the likes of Murray River pink salt from Australia, alder-smoked salt from the Pacific Northwest, or those cool pyramid-shaped crystals of <br> Maldon sea salt from England. These are all great candidates for a &#x201c;finishing salt,&#x201d; which simply designates a salt that has a bit more prominent role in a dish, often sprinkled over the top just before it&#x2019;s served. The coarse or flaky grains of these salts will contribute distinct texture on the tongue, their individual flavors more easily highlighted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This cracker recipe is an ideal means for trying out any and all of the different types of salts you have on hand. You might even consider mixing things up and topping a portion of the crackers with the different types.

It utilizes a variety of techniques, sometimes paralleling those found in major forms of therapeutic massage, as well as powerful new points discovered by Tina Sohn.<br><br>� This revised and enlarged edition now serves as a textbook for bodyworkers.<br><br>� Accompanied by extensive illustrations and twenty detailed treatments for a variety of common medical conditions, this teaching guide explains and demonstrates the proper execution of Amma Therapy techniques applied directly to the physical body.<br><br>� Includes nutritional and exercise recommendations providing a remarkably holistic guide for practitioners and students in all fields of bodywork.</p><p>Born into one of the eight hundred traditional ruling families of Korea, Tina Sohn comes from a line of Oriental physicians and masters of the martial arts. Legendary for her intuitive ability to sense and cure disease, she has been instructing others in the healing arts for over twenty-five years. Robert Sohn has used his life&#39;s studies in Eastern and Western philosophies and medicine to help engineer the development of the wholistic health movement in America. He is founder and former president of the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, and in 1986 was awarded the honor of Acupuncturist of the year. In 1976 Robert and Tina Sohn founded the Wholistic Health Center in Manhasset, New York, one of the largest wholistic health centers in the United States. In 1981 they founded the New Center for Wholistic Health Education and Research, now a state-accredited college of wholistic medicine. Located in Syosset, New York, the New Center College serves as a model for wholistic health care and a school for future generations of wholistic practitioners."<i>Amma Therapy</i> delivers exactly what the title says: this is the most comprehensive textbook for Oriental bodywork therapists in the English language.", <i>EastWest</i><br><br>"<i>Amma Therapy</i> presents Oriental medical theory in a clear and logical manner, detailing its philosophical and physiological bases from Eastern and Western points of view. It also gives a philosophical overview of wholistic health care and contrasts it to the Western scientific 'disease-care' system. A section on professional development, which is emphasized in the Sohns' program, includes a beautiful description of the stages of proprioceptive sensitivity that are available to the dedicated therapist. A detailed protocol addresses hand strengthening, full-body conditioning, and training in proper body alignment.

Though each state capitol bears some similarity to the other forty-nine, each in its architecture and design reflects uniquely the pride of its state, both culturally and historically. </p><p> For this unprecedented project, photographer Tom Patterson traveled to each of America's fifty state capitals to capture the architectural beauty and dignity of its capitol building in glorious large-format color images. </p><p> Writer Susan W. Thrane reveals fascinating details about each capitol building's beginnings:</p><ul> <li>the events surrounding construction</li> <li>background on its architects and builders</li> <li>dimensions and costs</li> <li>primary features and main rooms</li> <li>unique furnishings and works of art.</li> </ul><p></p><p> The book also discusses important moments in the history of each building and the state itself, including:</p><ul> <li>the origin of the state's name</li> <li>its capital city</li> <li>when the state was admitted to the Union, and</li> <li>the number of members in its legislative bodies.</li> </ul><p></p></p><p><p> <b>Susan Waddell Thrane</b> practiced law in Ohio before writing <i>County Courthouses of Ohio</i>. She is now involved in historic preservation in Thetford, Vermont, where she is a member of the local renovation and restoration committee. </p><p> <b>Tom Patterson</b>'s photography has appeared in a wide range of publications. His previous book, <i>County Courthouses of Ohio</i>, was also co-authored by Susan Waddell Thrane. He lives in Dayton, Ohio, where he operates a photography and graphic design studio. </p><p><b> Preface </b></p><p> My interest in state capitols can be traced back to my childhood in rural Iowa, not far from Iowa City, the state's first capital. There, amid the University of Iowa buildings and overlooking the Iowa River, stood the old stone Greek Revival capitol. To me it was the largest and most handsome building in the world. </p><p> My father knew its history: it was the territorial capitol (1842-1846) where Iowa inaugurated its first governor; home to the first six General Assemblies from 1846 to 1857; the site where the state constitution was drafted and where the state university was chartered in 1847. In fact, the capitol was the university's first permanent structure, and it housed the University of Iowa's administrative offices for over 113 years as the university built around and enveloped it. When my family traveled throughout the United States (most memorably in a 1948 Ford), we looked for state capitols, often recognizable by their Renaissance-style golden domes. </p><p> While preparing this book, I discovered that we were not alone in our interest. The admiration, even veneration, of people toward their civic temples became increasingly evident. This was especially clear to me the day I was visiting Des Moines and working in the elegant law library of the present Iowa State Capitol. I was interrupted by news from Iowa City that the first capitol, now a landmark, was burning. As the tragedy unfolded, I joined the librarians watching the collapse of its cupola on the Internet. Simultaneously, throughout the building and the state, distraught Iowans wept at their loss. </p><p> This respect and devotion are not surprising. Capitols are symbols of democracy. They are homes of history, where leaders are elected and laws are passed. Moreover, capitols reflect the unique past and identity of each state and, collectively, of the United States. Architecturally, despite the fact that at least thirty-two states have capitols with externally visible domes, each is distinctive. They are also repositories of arts and crafts in the stained glass, carved wood, delicate ironwork, mosaic tiles and large murals that are no longer economically feasible to incorporate into new public buildings. </p><p> Significantly, in our increasingly rootless twenty-first-century society, the capitols bring continuity from our past to the future. And the business carried on within these historic structures has become increasingly relevant to the lives of each of us as states assume a growing role in the fluctuating federal system. </p><p> The buildings notwithstanding, differences in the legislation of the fifty states demonstrate their unique character, One vintage legislation, "An Act Directing what Fence shall be deemed lawful," was enacted by the Vermont General Assembly in 1780, before Vermont became a part of the United States, and remains on the books. In contrast, the Wisconsin legislature outlawed oleomargarine until 1967 and still restricts its use. Throughout the book, many of the chapters contain examples of other laws passed in the legislative chambers of these buildings. </p><p> And along the way, what history and stories were discovered! During 1807, in the old house of the Virginia Capitol, Aaron Burr was tried for treason and acquitted, with John Marshall, chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, presiding. Angelina Grimke, the first woman known to address a state legislative body, gave a speech advocating the abolition of slavery in the old Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1838. In Ohio, in order to save money, the General Assembly drafted prisoners to build its state house. Jefferson Davis proclaimed independence and the birth of the Confederacy from Alabama's old state capitol, where later, in 1963, civil-rights activists protested Alabama's newly inaugurated governor, George Wallace. Wallace promised loyalty to segregation while standing on the capitol steps, within view of Martin Luther King's Dexter Avenue Baptist church. In Kansas, semi-nude women in frescoes commissioned by the Populist Patty were replaced with fully clothed figures when the Republican Party took control. </p><p> While these are special, singular events, one in particular that tied many of the state capitols together and focused national attention on them occurred following Lincoln's assassination, His body was transported from Washington, D.C., to Springfield, Illinois, by train, befitting his strong support of railroads, first as an attorney and then as president. </p><p> During a three-week period, the cort�ge stopped at Pennsylvania's capitol, in Harrisburg, and at New York's state capitol, in Albany, before his body was brought through the front doors of the state house in Columbus, Ohio, and lay in state for eight hours, Thousands of grieving Hoosiers later filed through the first Indianapolis State House, when for eighteen hours his body lay in state in its rotunda, For two days in Representatives Hall of the Illinois old capitol, seventy-five thousand mourners passed before his casket before the burial in his hometown of Springfield. This mourning did not take place in churches or business auditoriums but in state capitols, or as some call them, civic churches, symbolic of state government and American democracy. </p><p> Events such as these indicate that state capitols represent history, as well as being repositories of legislation, architectural design, and especially interior design and artwork, The art is more than decoration -- it conveys the state's history, by emphasizing public figures and events and by promoting government. Thomas Hart Benton and N.C. Wyeth created murals with westward expansion themes for Missouri's capitol in Jefferson City. The New Mexico State Capitol is considered an art museum, with changing displays of works by living New Mexican artists, reflecting the state's unique heritage. Charles M. Russell's painting of Lewis and Clark meeting Native Americans in 1805 dominates the Montana House chamber, while above the grand staircase is a mural depicting the driving of the golden spike commemorating the completion of the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railroad at Gold Creek, Montana, Also noteworthy are John Steuarr Curry's mural of John Brown in Kansas, Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington in Rhode Island, and Virginia's life-size statue of one of its favorite sons, George Washington. War memorials and statuary placed on the buildings and grounds include a statue of Sergeant Alvin C. York, a hero of the First World War, on the grounds of Tennessee's capitol and Daniel Chester French's sculpture of the gilded quadriga above the entrance portico of the Minnesota Capitol. Moreover, after the Civil War, installing such public art as Confederate memorials preserved the culture of the South. </p><p> Eager to absorb and connect with the fifty capitols, my journey began in New England, followed by the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest, then on to the remaining states. While Atlanta, Boston, Honolulu and Denver are major metropolitan centers, others exist and are primarily known because they are state capitols. Juneau, for example, has only about thirty-one thousand inhabitants. Helena, Frankfort, Augusta and Pierre are even smaller than Juneau, but Vermont's Montpelier is the smallest, with less than one third the population of Juneau. </p><p> Throughout this long project I came into contact with too many men and women to acknowledge individually their gracious and enthusiastic assistance. They include state archivists and librarians, state historical preservation officers, capitol curators and historians, legislative council attorneys and staff, capitol tour guides, state legislators and officials, I am, however, particularly indebted to my children, John Wilfong and Sara Wilfong, and my husband, Bill Thrane, for their ongoing encouragement, support and good humor. After a hiking accident that had a significant impact on my ability to proceed, they rearranged schedules, became my drivers and travel companions, took on additional domestic responsibilities, and overall contributed to maki</p></p><h2>Angels: God&#39;s Secret Agents</h2><p>The well-known evangelist explains the characteristics of angels as well as their purposes and significance in the contemporary world</p><p><i>Angels: God's Secret Agents</i> is Billy Graham's one-volume introduction to one of the most popular spiritual phenomena of our time. Firmly grounded in Graham's close readings of scripture, <i>Angels</i> testifies to Graham's own encounters with the heavenly beings and also records the many similar stories that other believers have told him over the years. Graham devotes entire chapters to the questions of whether angels are visible or invisible, how they differ from men and women, and how the angelic hierarchy is organized. He also discusses the much-debated theory that UFO sightings are in fact angelic appearances. <p> Perhaps the primary purpose of this book, however, is to inform readers that armies of angels are ready and willing to help Christians in their daily fights against the forces of darkness. "Millions of angels are at God's command and at our service," Graham writes. "The hosts of heaven stand at attention as we make our way from earth to glory, and Satan's BB guns are no match for God's heavy artillery." Such stirring theological pronouncements are matched with practical advice for believers who wish to know the angelic powers in everyday life. <i>--Kevin Attwood</i></p>Relating his personal experiences, Graham helps to call a world in crisis to faith.</p><h2>Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941</h2><p>Shirer&#39;s diary offers a first-hand account of Hitler&#39;s rise to power and the brutality, fanaticism, and lifestyles of Nazi Germany as the nation prepared for and the waged war</p><p>"There is absolutely no better book by an American about the rise of the Third Reich.

She also authored a novella, <em>The Catch Colt</em>, and <em>Wyoming Summer</em>, based on her diary of sixteen years. She died on October 14, 1980.</p>This classic story about a boy and his horse still stands strong. It's more an inspiring account of growing up and gaining self-assurance than it is a horse story. Wells is a surprising choice for narrating this book. His voice is urban and sophisticated, with no hint of soft edges that might be more suitable for a novel set in a simpler time in the American West. Fortunately, Wells deftly handles the life lessons discovered by 9-year-old Ken. Through Wells's voice we sense the vast gap between Ken's gentle mother and his demanding father, and what each parent brings to the son.

A spectacular 7,000-year-old engraving in Libya depicts a catfight. Figures modeled by the Babylonians remind us of their belief that the souls of priests were escorted to paradise by a helpful cat. Pablo Picasso was known to have loved cats and famously portrayed them as savage predators. In Victorian times, cats were depicted in loving family groups with mothers caring for their playful kittens. Today, the cat is one of the most popular domestic pets on the planet, and feline art is a hugely popular theme across the world.<br><br> In his latest eye-catching book, best-selling author Desmond Morris tells the compelling story of cats in art. He explores feline art in its many forms, tracing its history from ancient rock paintings and spectacular Egyptian art to the work of old masters, avant-garde representations, and the depiction of cats in cartoons. Morris discusses the various ways in which artists have approached the subject throughout history, weaving illuminating stories with rarely seen images. The result is a beautifully illustrated book that will delight anyone with a Kitty, Max, or Tigger in their life.</p><p><b>Desmond Morris</b> is a world-renowned zoologist and television presenter and the author of many best-selling books on human and animal behavior.

He proved to be a formidable enemy, campaigning against the Cherokee, Creeks, Chickasaws, and other peoples, some of them former allies against England in the Revolution and the War of 1812. In doing so, he established precedents that his compatriots would follow for the rest of the 19th century.<p> Robert Remini, the National Book Award-winning biographer of Jackson, here turns his attention to Jackson's relations with the Indian nations of the American South. Those relations, he writes, were tempered by the racism of the day, but, as both general and president, Jackson was also unusual in enforcing rights guaranteed to those nations by treaty, even in instances when he disagreed with the terms. Despite his sense of justice, Jackson kept to his conviction that "Indians had to be shunted to one side or removed to make the land safe for white people to cultivate and settle," and during his tenure as president he pursued a policy of forced removal through which the Indian nations were relocated to the so-called Indian territories west of the Mississippi River, which in turn would be overrun only a few years later.</p><p> Though critical of Jackson's policies and actions, Remini suggests that removal saved many of the eastern Indian nations from almost certain annihilation. That view, while capably argued, is controversial, and some scholars of American Indian history are sure to take issue with it. Still, this is a valuable addition to the historical literature, one of interest to general readers as well as Remini's fellow historians. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Robert V. Remini, professor emeritus of history and the humanities at the University of Illinois at Chicago, won the National Book Award for his three-volume biography of Andrew Jackson. He is the author of numerous books on American history, including <i>The Battle of New Orleans</i> and biographies of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster.</p><h2>The Complete Poems</h2><p>Member of Parliament, tutor to Oliver Cromwell&#39;s ward, satirist and friend of John Milton, Andrew Marvell was one of the most interesting and important poets of the seventeenth century. The Complete Poems demonstrates his unique skill and immense diversity to the full, and includes lyrical love-poetry, religious works and biting satire. From the passionately erotic To his Coy Mistress, to the astutely political Cromwellian poems and the profoundly spiritual On a Drop of Dew, in which he considers the nature of the soul, these works are masterpieces of clarity and metaphysical imagery. Eloquent and compelling, they remain among the most vital and profound works of the era - works by a figure who, in the words of T. S. Eliot, speaks clearly and unequivocally with the voice of his literary age&#39;.</p><p>Marvell, Andrew (1621--78), was one of the English Metaphysical Poets. Educated at Cambridge, he worked as a clerk, traveled abroad, and returned to serve as tutor to Lord Fairfax&#39;s daughter in Yorkshire. In 1657 he was appointed John Milton&#39;s assistant in the Latin secretaryship, and in 1659 he was elected to Parliament, where he served until his death. He was one of the chief wits and satirists of his time as well as being a Puritan and a public defender of individual liberty. Today, however, he is known chiefly for his brilliant lyric poetry, which includes The Garden, The Definition of Love, Bermudas, and To His Coy Mistress, and for his Horatian Ode to Cromwell.Text: English, Greek, Latin</p><h2>100 Pin Loom Squares: 100 Exciting Color Combinations to Try, Plus 15 Stylish Projects (Knit &amp; Crochet Blocks &amp; Squares)</h2><p><p>Now, weaving is as portable as knitting!

With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics. Her writings live on into the twenty-first century as America&#x2019;s quintessential pioneer story.</p><br><br><p><strong>Garth Williams</strong> is the renowned illustrator of almost one hundred books for children, including the beloved <em>Stuart Little</em>&nbsp;by E. B. White,&nbsp;<em>Bedtime for Frances</em>&nbsp;by Russell Hoban, and the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder.</p><p>He was born in 1912 in New York City but raised in England. He founded an art school near London and served with the British Red Cross Civilian Defense during World War II. Williams worked as a portrait sculptor, art director, and magazine artist before doing his first book&nbsp;<em>Stuart Little</em>, thus beginning a long and lustrous career illustrating some of the best known children's books.</p><p>In addition to illustrating works by White and Wilder, he also illustrated George Selden&#x2019;s <em>The Cricket in Times Square </em>and its sequels (Farrar Straus Giroux). He created the character and pictures for the first book in the Frances series by Russell Hoban (HarperCollins) and the first books in the Miss Bianca series by Margery Sharp (Little, Brown). He collaborated with Margaret Wise Brown on her Little Golden Books titles <em>Home for a Bunny</em> and<em> Little Fur Family,</em> among others, and with Jack Prelutsky on two poetry collections published by Greenwillow: <em>Ride a Purple Pelican</em> and <em>Beneath a Blue Umbrella</em>. He also wrote and illustrated seven books on his own, including <em>Baby Farm Animals</em> (Little Golden Books) and <em>The Rabbits&#x2019; Wedding</em> (HarperCollins).</p></p><h2>Cecil Beaton: A Biography</h2><p>Traces the life of the famous British photographer, describes his middle class childhood, and attempts to portray his complex personality</p><p>Beaton occupies an honored position as one of the foremost photographers of the 20th century. Before his death in 1980, he appointed Vickers as his official biographer. The result is this painstakingly researched volume, profusely illustrated with Beaton's own photographs. Beaton also achieved fame as an Oscar-winning costume and set designer, illustrator, portraitist, writer, and court photographer. Vickers looks closely at Beaton's several great loves, including his years with Greta Garbo, as well as his failure to become a playwright, his greatest dream. Perhaps the most telling aspect of this handsome and talented man is his fascination/obsession with the rich and famous and his abiding snobbism. For libraries where interest in Beaton or photography exists, this will be a substantial addition.Terrill Brooks, Baker Coll.

Carlson gives a brief history of the North American westward movement as a framework for introducing more than 50 appropriate activities, which are presented chronologically and thematically and include projects involving exploration, fur trading, the gold rush, homesteading, and cowboys. Activities range from the very simple (making notepaper decorated with an Appaloosa motif) to the complex (hooking a rag rug); most have very clear directions. A few ideas (panning for gold) will be impractical for most readers; some (Lewis and Clark's journal and field book, a trapper's journal, and a young girl's travel diary) are repetitive; but most (especially the recipes for portable soup and root beer and the explanations of measuring land for townships and homesteads) will be of interest. Black line drawings and frequent sidebars help break up the text and further clarify the instructions.

As we follow the arc of Jasper Johns's career - from the raw loft he lived in as an unknown artist to the dining rooms of wealthy collectors that he now frequents as a "consummated artist" - we discover an artist who has consistently introduced intensely intimate elements into his work yet is compelled to disguise and deny those very elements.<br>The book begins with a mystery - Jill Johnston's search for the source of a hidden figure in a number of Johns's paintings. That figure - which she identifies as a grotesquely diseased and dying man - opens a path to the autobiographical core in the work of this most secretive of visual artists. Her discoveries lead us to the Johns family roots in South Carolina, and then to the New York art community of the early 1950s, when the fabulous foursome of Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, and Merce Cunningham challenged the conventions of modern art, dance, and music. As Johnston charts the evolution of Johns's private and public identities, she interviews friends and associates and attends the openings and ceremonies that punctuate Johns's extraordinarily successful career. Along the way are several enigmatic encounters with Johns himself: a downtown luncheon interview, a chance meeting at the Venice Biennale, and a dinner with Johns and a number of his wealthy patrons at Si Newhouse's elegant Manhattan townhouse.<br>Critics until now have been primarily concerned with Johns's formal strategies, seeing the autobiographical elements in his work as "privileged information," inappropriate for critical comment. But Johnston's achievement is to put this unexpected dimension of intimate information squarely at the center of his work. Readers of her brilliantly original account will come away with a larger, more resonant sense of Johns's art.</p><p>An artist's private life is often reflected in his work. Frequently the private is made public, and often this connection makes the work more accessible and interesting. Critic Jill Johnston has taken on the task of exploring the life and work of Jasper Johns--that most private of contemporary artists--and has succeeded brilliantly. Johnston is not simply out to reveal Johns's gayness but to explore how his sexuality has shaped his life and work. Johnston's critical eye is unwavering, her ability to delineate political and social contexts is unnervingly on-target. The fact that Johns resisted Johnston's efforts at biography gives the book an underlying tension making it even more fascinating. <i>Jasper Johns: Privileged Information</i> is a fine, intelligent work of biography and criticism.A socio-psychological piece of detection that attempts to put the painter Jasper Johns and his work on the couch. Without the artist's cooperation (Johns refused to allow reproduction of his work) Johnston (Lesbian Nation, 1972; Paper Daughter, 1985; etc.) has fashioned a book that is part critical study and part biographical exploration. At the heart of Johns's art, Johnston argues, is a father-son struggle, expressed in the symbolic paternity most associated with flags, but which emerges more specifically in two partially repressed figures that have appeared since 1981. Inspired by Gr newald's 16th-century Isenheim Altarpiece, one is a soldier present at the Resurrection; the other is a mangy, suffering, slightly demonic figure adapted from The Temptation of St. Anthony. The two figures embody, for Johnston, imagery suggesting the loss Johns suffered as an infant, when his mother abandoned the family and his father, an alcoholic, withdrew from his young son. This is not purely reductive work: Johnston's writing is engrossing, and she is always willing to try a new approach rather than succumb to any one rigid method of interpretation. The art critics who have written about Johns's work in the past, Johnston argues, have been all too happy to accept and reflect the artist's unwillingness to talk about influences and intentions. ``The two interlocking components in the progress of America's wealthiest artist--a powerful dead father and a helpless driven son--are the very sorts of circumstances the art world conspires to help its practitioners forget and transcend. The commodity is art.'' However, we err, she suggests, in ignoring the life behind the art. This is a rich, provocative, satisfying book, filled with gorgeous descriptions of paintings and offering a fascinating dissection of the art scene, as well as a subtle portrait of one of its most elusive stars. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

IP.</p><p>When travel writer Charles Prentice arrives at Estrella de Mar, a resort town near Gibraltar populated primarily by British retirees, to find out why his brother Frank has been jailed, he's shocked to find that Frank has confessed to a spectacular act of arson that left five people dead. Charles tries to find the real culprit by hanging around Estrella de Mar, which one resident describes as "like Chelsea or Greenwich Village in the 1960s. There are theatre and film clubs, a choral society, cordon blue classes.... Stand still for a moment and you find yourself roped into a revival of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>." But the longer he stays, the more confused Charles is by the residents' breezy lack of concern about the constant background of vandalism, rape, prostitution, and drug dealing.<p> Things become clearer as Charles makes the acquaintance of local tennis pro Bobby Crawford, who has some interesting hypotheses about how to maintain the quality of the inner life in the age of affluence. As another of the locals explains, "Leisure societies lie ahead of us, like those you see on this coast. People ... will retire in their late thirties, with fifty years of idleness in front of them.... But how do you energize people, give them some sense of community?" Bobby's succinct answer, provided to Charles in another context: "There's nothing like a violent reflex now and then to tune up the nervous system." Bobby convinces Charles to help him replicate his social experiment in an adjacent retirement community, slowly convincing him that crime and creativity really do go hand in hand. But who, if anybody, takes the responsibility?</p><p> <i>Cocaine Nights</i> resonates quite neatly with Ballard's earlier science fiction and experimental stories. As early as <i>The Atrocity Exhibition</i>, Ballard was speculating about the salubrious effects of transgression, and his science fiction novel <i>High Rise</i> also deals with the introduction of violence to a self-contained paradise. <i>Cocaine Nights</i> differs from that earlier work primarily in that it is a naturalistic fiction set in a world that is much more ostensibly real, a world that, with a little less detached theorizing (even at his most natural, it seems, Ballard cannot help but be clinical) on the part of its characters, might even be mistaken for real. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>J.

His left leg throbbed painfully, not only the tender, swollen tissue nearest the fracture in the bone but everything from ankle to knee, the muscles sore from too many days in stirrups, the skin chafed raw from the reluctant doctor&#x2019;s hasty splint. Grimacing, every movement a new torment, he propped himself up on his elbows and strained his ears to listen.</p><p>There&#x2014; a low whisper, quick footfalls, and, more distant, the jingle of spurs. And then, incautiously, two men arguing in hushed voices, one commanding, one pleading. A flicker of candlelight illuminated the shallow depression beneath the door of the tobacco barn, and&#x2014; e jerked his head sharply when a sudden gleam caught the corner of his eye&#x2014; the glint of a lantern appeared between the slats on the opposite side.</p><p>The barn was surrounded.</p><p>Blood pounded in his ears as he inched closer to his companion, grimacing in pain as he dragged himself from his makeshift bed on the hay strewn floor. Covering the younger man&#x2019;s mouth with one hand, with the other he grasped him by the shoulder and shook him awake. "Herold," he murmured, his gaze darting from the door to the four walls. "Wake up."</p><p>David Herold woke with a start. "What is it, John?" he whispered hoarsely. "Is Garrett running us off after all?"</p><p>Richard Garrett, the lean, grim- aced farmer who had welcomed them into his home earlier that day, had banished them to the barn upon discovering their true identities. Adding to the insult, he had locked them in to ensure that they wouldn&#x2019;t run off with the family&#x2019;s horses in the night. Had Garrett betrayed them to the men now drawing the cordon tight around their refuge? When put to the test, had the Virginia farmer&#x2019;s Southern sympathies given way to craven fear?</p><p>Rage flared up within John, hot and searing, only to sputter and die out, extinguished by hard, cold truth. It mattered not how their pursuers had found them, only that they had.</p><p>"Our pursuers are upon us," he told Herold, his voice preternaturally calm.</p><p>Muttering an oath, Herold scrambled to sit up, his short stature and fine wisps of facial hair making him seem even younger than his almost twenty-three years. "Should we surrender before they open fire?"</p><p>"I&#x2019;ll suffer death first." John pulled Herold close and added in a voice scarcely more than a breath, "Don&#x2019;t make a sound. Maybe they&#x2019;ll think we aren&#x2019;t here and go away."</p><p>At that moment, the plaintive creak of hinges drew their attention to the door, which was slowly, cautiously opening. A figure stepped into the doorway, thrown into silhouette by a distant lantern. "Gentlemen, the cavalry are after you." It was Jack Garrett, the farmer&#x2019;s eldest son, recently returned from the war. He had been clad in a gray Confederate uniform when they first met&#x2014; had it really been only the previous afternoon?</p><p>"You&#x2019;re the ones they seek." Jack Garrett&#x2019;s voice gathered strength as it probed the darkness. "You&#x2019;d better give yourselves up."</p><p>"John Wilkes Booth," another man proclaimed, emerging in the doorway behind Jack Garrett, a candle in his fist. "I want you to surrender. If you don&#x2019;t, in fifteen minutes I&#x2019;ll burn the barn down around you."</p><p>Grasping his injured leg, John drew himself up as tall as he could sit. "And who are you, sir?" he demanded, his voice ringing as it had from the stage of Grover&#x2019;s Theatre, the Arch Street Theatre, the National, the Marshall, Ford&#x2019;s&#x2014; the scenes of his greatest triumphs. He could triumph here yet. "This is a hard case. It may be that I am to be taken by my friends."</p><p>"I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Luther Byron Baker, detective, United States Department of War, and I order you to turn your weapons over to Garrett and give yourself up."</p><p>Herold, trembling and sweating despite the cold, took his head in his hands, moaning softly through clenched teeth. "You don&#x2019;t choose to give yourself up," he told John shakily. "But I do. Let me go out."</p><p>"No." John forced his voice to remain steady, his heart thudding in time with the throbbing of his injured leg. "You shall not."</p><p>As they argued, their voices low and heated, John&#x2019;s mouth went dry and a fearful tremor seized him. He was aware of Garrett speaking over his shoulder to the other men as he backed away from the doorway, and of Herold slipping from his control. Another ten minutes and the boy&#x2019;s terror would overcome him entirely. Before that moment came, John must sow enough confusion to conceal their escape, or all would be lost.</p><p>He seized Herold by the shoulder&#x2014; to restrain his companion as well as to brace himself against his own rising panic. "Surely we can come to an understanding between gentlemen," he called grandly, projecting his voice through the doorway to the officer lurking outside. "If I had been inclined to shoot my way to freedom, your candle would have made you an easy target."</p><p>Silence followed his declaration, and as he watched, the thin light wavered, shadows shifting as Baker carried the candle away and planted it on some hillock in the yard. Boots scraping on hard packed earth alerted him to the officer&#x2019;s return. "Give up your arms or the barn will be set on fire," the lieutenant commanded. A low growl of assent revealed his companions&#x2019; numbers&#x2014; a dozen at least, fully armed, no doubt, filled with misguided, righteous anger, panting to avenge their slain leader. John knew nothing would convince them that he had saved them from a tyrant.</p><p>In the diminished light, his gaze traveled the length and width of the barn, searching, hoping. There must be an escape, even now. He and young Herold could flee to Mexico, where Emperor Maximilian was offering refuge and substantial bounties to steadfast Confederates. There he would at last be proclaimed a hero, as he had not been in Maryland, Virginia, or anywhere in the ungrateful South. There, Lucy&#x2019;s studies of the Spanish tongue would serve them well.</p><p>Lucy, he thought, picturing her as he had last seen her, smiling and beautiful in the dining room of the National Hotel. Sweet Lucy. What did she think of him now? Would her love remain true, or did she too abhor him? Surely he could make her understand that the fractured nation owed all her troubles to Lincoln. The country had groaned beneath his tyranny and had prayed for this end, and God had made John the instrument of His perfect wrath. How bewildering it was, in the aftermath of the deed that should have made him great, to find himself abandoned by the very people he served, in desperate flight with the mark of Cain upon him, but if the world knew his heart, if Lucy knew his heart&#x2014; his courage faltering, he forced thoughts of his beloved aside. "My good sir," he called out, stalling for time, thoughts racing, "that&#x2019;s rather rough. I&#x2019;m nothing but a cripple. I have but one leg, and you ought to give me a chance for a fair fight."</p><p>"We&#x2019;re not here to argue," Baker shouted back, anger and impatience whetting the edge of his voice. "You&#x2019;ve got five minutes left to consider the matter."</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t need five minutes, Booth," said Herold, rising, clenching his hands, pacing, his anxious gaze fixed upon the doorway. "They got us cornered. We got no choice but to give up. Don&#x2019;t you see? We&#x2019;ve gone as far as we can."</p><p>John would not concede that they had, not while breath remained in his body. Again and again he tried to engage Baker in conversation, but the Yankee lieutenant would neither negotiate nor be distracted, insisting that the fugitives consider their circumstances and make their choice. Increasingly frustrated, John looked to Herold, who paced and gnawed his fingernails to the quick and would clearly be no help at all.</p><p>"Well, then," John called to Baker almost cheerfully, "throw open the door, draw up your men in line, and let&#x2019;s have a fair fight."</p><p>"Garrett," said another man, whose voice John had not yet heard, "gather some of those pine twigs and pile them up by the sides of the barn."</p><p>"What does he mean?" Herold asked, panic infiltrating his voice. "What are they doing?"</p><p>"Calm yourself." John strained his ears to detect Garrett&#x2019;s retreat, and soon thereafter, returning footfalls and the sound of an armload of pine boughs falling in a pile near the door. Alarmed, he shouted, "Put no more brush there or someone will get hurt."</p><p>"Booth." Herold backed into the center of the barn, gaze darting wildly, hands spread as if to ward off an invisible foe. "Booth&#x2014;"</p><p>"Herold, I told you&#x2014;" A whiff of smoke in the air silenced him, the crackle of new flame. Quickly he discovered the source&#x2014; someone had twisted hay into a makeshift wick, set it on fire, and shoved it through a crack between the boards of the barn wall. He watched, thunderstruck, as flames licked greedily at the wooden planks, steadily climbing, cutting through the shadows with garish light.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m going," Herold croaked, pale with terror. "I don&#x2019;t intend to be burnt alive."</p><p>As the younger man strode toward the door, John quickly reached out and seized the cuff of his trousers, gasping as stabbing pains shot up his broken leg. "Take another step and I&#x2019;ll kill you."</p><p>Herold gaped at him, his mouth open in silent protest, his pouchy cheeks quivering, his face eerily young in the rising light of the blaze. Suddenly John recalled how obediently Herold had served the conspiracy over the past year, how faithfully he had served John throughout their flight from Washington&#x2014; guiding him through the backwoods and swamps of Maryland and Virginia, finding them safe havens with sympathetic civilians along the way, risking his life in dangerous river crossings, tending John in his infirmity. John remembered, and he regretted his cruel threat.</p><p>He must save the boy, if he could not save them both.</p><p>"Get away from me, you damned coward," he snarled loudly for the audience outside. As Herold pulled away, John yanked him back again and added in a whisper, "When you get out, don&#x2019;t tell them what arms I carry."</p><p>Bewildered, Herold mutely nodded, stumbling backward when John released him.</p><p>"Lieutenant Baker," John called out, "there is a man in here who wants to surrender. He is innocent of any crime."</p><p>After a moment&#x2019;s pause, Baker called back, "Pass your weapons through the door and come out with your hands in the air."</p><p>"He has no weapons." John coughed and waved away a tendril of smoke scented with wood and tobacco and straw. A trickle of sweat ran from his temple to his jaw. "All the arms here are mine."</p><p>In a panic, Herold sprinted to the door, only to find it barred against him. "Let me out," he shrieked, pounding on the door. "Let me out!"</p><p>The door swung open. A soldier ordered Herold to extend his hands, one at a time, and the moment he obeyed, someone seized his wrists and yanked him out of sight. Before the door swung shut again, John glimpsed rifles and pistols trained upon the entrance, gleaming in the light from the burning barn.</p><p>The blaze had scaled the walls and spread to the rafters, roaring and crackling and filling the air with choking smoke. Scooting away from the walls, dragging his injured leg after him, John looked about for something, anything, to put out the fire. Instead through the cracks between the wooden planks he glimpsed the pale faces of Union soldiers outside, angry and curious, emboldened by Herold&#x2019;s surrender. They watched him with hungry avarice, like a vicious pack of dogs studying a cornered stag.</p><p>Resolute, he took his Spencer carbine in hand and reached for his crutch. If these were to be his last moments, he would not spend them lying in the dirty straw, helpless and despairing, so his enemies might watch him roast alive. As quickly as he dared, he pushed himself to his feet and steadied himself on the crutch.</p><p>He had nowhere to go but into the arms of his vengeful enemies.</p><p>Supporting his weight on the crutch, he made his way to the door, wincing as a shower of sparks flew too close before his face. The crutch slipped from beneath his outstretched arm as he reached for the latch, but he let it fall. He would face the soldiers standing, defiant and proud on his own two feet.</p><p>He drew himself up as he shuffled into the doorway, and raised his carbine&#x2014; and then he was lying on his face in the dirt, his head spinning, his neck trembling electrically as if in the aftermath of a lightning strike, his strong body strangely limp and heavy. He could not open his eyes, or dared not try.</p><p>He heard the faint thunder of quick footfalls, felt the strike of the soldiers&#x2019; boots on the earth transmitted through the ground to his forehead. Something warm and liquid trickled from his neck down his collar past his clavicle, over the old scar he boasted as a war wound, but when he reached up to brush the irritant away, his hand and arm did not respond. Dimly he puzzled over this oddity as the men gathered around him.</p><p>"Is he dead?" an unfamiliar voice queried, shrill with excitement. "Did he shoot himself?"</p><p>"No," replied Lieutenant Baker. "I don&#x2019;t think so. I don&#x2019;t know what happened."</p><p>John wanted nothing more than to riposte with a mocking jest, but the words eluded him, whirling beyond his fingertips like cottonwood seeds caught in a sudden gale. He felt them swirling about him, small and white and soft, thousands upon thousands, felt himself sinking into them as they mounded up around him on all sides. The crackling blaze faded, its light and sound growing faint, but the smell of scorched tobacco and ash lingered in his nostrils, a curious singularity that kept the white softness from engulfing him completely.</p><p>There were hands upon him, he realized, inquisitive and none too gentle. He had been shot, he heard someone say. They found the wound on the right side of his neck. Someone had disobeyed orders and had shot the most despised man in America, robbing the Yankees of the trial and execution they surely craved.</p><p>John felt himself rising, lifted roughly and carried away from the heat and light that flickered beyond his closed eyelids. He heard the crash of a roof falling in as he was placed on a patch of soft grass, his face turned toward the stars. Slowly at first, and then in a torrent, the blood rushed in his ears, and his head began to pound. He ached all over, his strangely heavy, frozen body sparking with pain.</p><p>He had been shot through the neck, he realized, vaguely astonished, as the last of the white softness blew away. He was probably dying.</p><p>He tried to speak, but he could manage no more than a wheeze, which was enough to draw the men closer. "Thought he was dead already," one muttered.</p><p>"He&#x2019;s on his way to dying," said another. "Hold on, he&#x2019;s trying to talk."</p><p>"Tell&#x2014;" John rasped. "Tell her&#x2014;"</p><p>A slim figure bent over him, lowered an ear close to John&#x2019;s mouth. "Go on."</p><p>John took a shuddering breath through the thick fluid collecting in his throat. "Tell my mother . . . I die for my country."</p><p>Nearby, a man cursed. Another spat in the dirt. "Tell your mother you die for your country," the slim figure repeated slowly. "Do I have that right...</p></p><h2>The Widow</h2><p><br><br>Four days after Abigail Browning's wedding, her life changed unimaginably: her husband was fatally shot along the rocky Mount Desert Island coast. Was it a random act of violence, or could someone have wanted Christopher dead?<br><br>That's the question that has haunted Abigail, now a homicide detective, for the past seven years. Determined to find her husband's killer, she returns to the foggy Maine island after receiving an anonymous tip. Is it just another false lead, or can she finally prove that Chris was murdered?<br><br>Owen Garrison, the search-and-rescue worker who located Chris too late to save him, still carries guilt from that fateful night. As he helps Abigail unravel the mystery, they learn that the layers of deceit and lies are even thicker than they could have imagined.

Another two spiral notebooks.<br><br>She set her lighter fluid on the little wooden shelf next to the grill and picked up the top notebook from the plastic chair behind her.

Tools clattering to the floor in the back room. A hammer. Perhaps a crowbar. I'm startled, but also amused, because I'd spent the morning helping Chris repair a leak.<br><br>As I get up to investigate the noises, I think it must be an unwritten rule&#x2014;newlyweds aren't supposed to fix leaks on their honeymoon.<br><br>Abigail tore off that first page by itself and ripped it into quarters, setting them neatly atop her pile, the lighter fluid seeping into the cheap paper and old blue ink as if it were fresh tears.<br><br>Last night's anonymous call had changed everything. She needed a cover story to explain her actions&#x2014;what she planned to do next.<br><br>She also needed clarity and objectivity.<br><br>Seven years of journals. Seven years, she thought, of trying to restore her emotional life.<br><br>I smell roses and ocean as I get up from the couch. A window must be open.<br><br>Even now, at thirty-two, no longer a young bride, no longer a law student with a handsome FBI special agent husband, no longer inexperienced in matters of violent death, Abigail could feel herself walking into the back room, convinced the wind had knocked over tools she and Chris had left haphazardly that morning, when they gave up their leak-fixing to make love upstairs in their sun-filled bedroom.<br><br>She noticed the slight tremble in her hands and swore under her breath, tensing her fingers as she tore more pages and set them atop her pile. There was no wind, and the grass&#x2014;what there was of it in her postage stamp of a backyard&#x2014;was damp from an overnight rain. Adequate conditions for burning, although she was in a tank top and shorts. If her bare skin got hit with sparks, it'd serve her right.<br><br>As I step into the back room, I see not a cracked window but the door to the porch standing wide open, and for the first time I feel a jolt of real fear.<br><br>I didn't leave the door open. "Chris?"<br><br>I call my husband's name just as I hear the floor-boards creak behind me.<br><br>Just as the blow comes to the back of my head.<br><br>Her chest tightening, Abigail dropped the partially torn spiral notebook back onto the chair and quickly struck a wooden match, tossing it onto the pile of ripped pages.<br><br>Flames shot two feet into the hot, still air. <br><br>"Whoa, there. That's some fire you've got going." <br><br>She looked up at Bob O'Reilly trotting down the last of the steps from his top-floor apartment in the triple-decker they and Scoop Wisdom&#x2014;all three of them detectives with the Boston Police Department&#x2014;had bought together a year ago, pooling their resources to afford the city's sky-high real estate prices. Bob, a twice-divorced father of three, lived alone. Scoop, who worked in internal affairs and had a well-earned reputation with the women of Boston, occupied the middle floor. Abigail, a homicide detective and widow, had the first floor. She got along with Bob and Scoop partly because they understood she had no intention of sleeping with either of them.<br><br>"Outdoor burning's illegal," Bob said.<br><br>"I'm getting ready to throw some hot dogs on the grill."<br><br>"You don't eat hot dogs."<br><br>"Salmon, then."<br><br>At six-two, the veteran detective had nine inches on Abigail in height, and, although he was pushing fifty, he could run ten miles and still move the next day. He'd taught her how to use free weights properly, and he'd taught her crime scene investigation. She'd taught him what it was like to lose someone to violence.<br><br>She'd taught him that seven years was the blink of an eye. <br><br>A page, filled with bloodred ink, went up in flames.<br><br>As I regain consciousness, I feel the ice pack on the lump on the back of my head and almost vomit from the raging pain of my concussion.<br><br>"Don't move," my husband tells me quietly. "An ambulance is on the way."<br><br>I try to tell him that I'm fine, but I become very still as I notice the anger in his face. The knowledge. The awful sense of betrayal.<br><br>He knows who did this to me.<br><br>Bob pointed at the five-pound Folgers coffee can that she had set on the plastic chair, behind the stack of spiral notebooks. "What's that for?"<br><br>"The ashes."<br><br>"Come again?"<br><br>"I'm performing a cleansing ritual."<br><br>"A firebug I arrested ten years ago said the same thing."<br><br>"This is different," Abigail said, watching the pages blacken and burn. Once Bob left, she'd finish tearing up the last two notebooks, burn their pages, rid herself of their raw emotion.<br><br>Detective Bob O'Reilly of the BPD wouldn't understand cleansing rituals. He had pale skin and freckles and red hair that was graying gracefully; only his cornflower eyes suggested the work he'd done for almost thirty years ever got to him. His second wife had walked out on him two years ago, telling him he was an emotional basket case and recommending therapy. Instead, Bob got drunk with cop friends, packed up his stuff, and, swearing off marriage forever, moved out, eventually buying the triple-decker with Scoop and Abigail.<br><br>"Is that your handwriting? The purple ink?" he asked. <br><br>Abigail glanced at a scrap that had just caught fire. "I used different colored inks depending on my mood."<br><br>"How's a purple-ink mood different from, say, a blue-ink mood?"<br><br>"I don't know. It just is."<br><br>"What are these, journals or something?" He seemed to have to struggle to keep the disbelief out of his tone.<br><br>"I started keeping a journal after Chris died. My therapist suggested it."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>"She said to write stream-of-consciousness, without thinking, but to try to use all five senses and the present tense. She wanted me to write about our time together...what happened when he died."<br><br>Bob scratched the back of his thick neck. "It helped?"<br><br>"I don't know. I guess. I haven't thrown myself off Cadillac Mountain."<br><br>She grabbed the partially torn notebook and opened it up to the middle, tearing a hunk of pages, trying not to look at the words.<br><br>Chris leaves me with the ambulance crew, who will take me to the emergency room at the hospital in Bar Harbor. He doesn't say where he's going. He doesn't promise to be back soon. He doesn't promise anything.<br><br>I have no premonition of anything bad about to happen.<br><br>I just don't want him to leave me.<br><br>Bob unhooked a pair of tongs from the side of the grill and stirred the blackened pages, rekindling the dying fire. "You never thought about killing yourself, Abigail," he said, not looking at her. "Only thing you thought about was finding out who killed your husband."<br><br>She flung more pages on the fire.<br><br>By nightfall, I'm worried. So are Doyle Alden, a local police officer, and Owen Garrison, Chris's rich neighbor. I can see it in their faces.<br><br>Chris should be back by now.<br><br>"Abigail? You're not breathing."<br><br>She made herself exhale and smiled at Bob, who, initially, hadn't even wanted her in the department, much less working at his side in homicide. Too much baggage, he'd told everyone, including her. It wasn't just her husband. It was quitting law school, it was her background. She'd had to earn his trust. "I'm okay. I should have done this sooner. It feels good."<br><br>"Why are you doing it now?"<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Bob wasn't one to miss anything.<br><br>Abigail tore more pages, tossed them whole onto the fire, nearly smothering it.<br><br>I ignore warnings to stay inside&#x2014;to rest&#x2014;and instead put on my hiking boots and go off on my own into the unfamiliar landscape. Unlike Doyle and Owen and my husband, I don't know every rock, every tree root, every snaking path through the woods or along the shore.<br><br>I'm not from Mt. Desert Island.<br><br>Bob watched her squirt more charcoal lighter fluid on her fire, the orange flames glowing in his face.<br><br>"The journals are emotional clutter&#x2014;a drag on me." Her words sounded okay to her, anyway. Plausible. "I'm heading up to Maine in the morning."<br><br>"I see."<br><br>"I need to do some work on the house."<br><br>"Taking vacation time?"<br><br>"Some. Things are quiet right now. I have plenty of time coming to me."<br><br>Bob poked at the fire with his tongs. He wasn't by nature a patient man, but he had explained to Abigail, equally impatient, how his experience had taught him the value of strategic silence. She knew if she tried to fill the void, he'd have her.<br><br>The combination of the lighter fluid, the flames, the heat and the emotion had her eyes stinging. But she didn't cry.<br><br>She'd never cried in front of Bob or Scoop, any of her fellow police officers.<br><br>I see Owen Garrison down on the rocks, near the waterline, below the skeletal remains of the original Garrison house, burned in the great Mt. Desert fire of 1947.<br><br>I can taste the ocean on the air and smell the acidic odor of the damp, peat-laden earth. <br><br>My mind doesn't want to take in what I'm seeing. <br><br>The body of a man.<br><br>Owen tries to stop me from running. "Don't, Abigail..."<br><br>She picked up the spiral notebook on the bottom of her pile. The last one to burn, and the first one she'd filled, the handwriting oversized and thick, a pen difficult for her to hold in those initial, terrible weeks of rage, shock and grief.<br><br>With a sharp breath, she ripped out too many pages at once and distorted the metal spiral, ended up tearing sheets on an angle. She threw what she had onto the fire and pulled off the bits that had stayed behind, then grabbed another fistful and yanked those pages free.<br><br>Bob O'Reilly continued to watch her. <br><br>"I'm taking the ashes with me to Maine. As many as I can fit in the coffee can. I'm going to dump them in Frenchman Bay. It's part of the ritual."<br><br>"Should be pretty up there," he said.<br><br>I keep running. I don't slip on the rocks or hesitate, even as Owen grabs me by the waist. "Chris was shot, Abigail. He's dead. I'm sorry. There's nothing you can do now."<br><br>Owen won't let me go to my husband. He won't let me contaminate the crime scene when there's no hope.<br><br>All we can do now, he says, is find the killer.<br><br>Bob hooked the tongs back onto the side of the grill. "Forget it, Detective Browning. You're not fooling me. You're not even coming close. Cleansing rituals. Emotional clutter." He snorted. "Bullshit."<br><br>Abigail tilted her head back and gave him a lofty look. She could feel her tank top sticking to her back. Her hair, short and dark, had twisted itself into corkscrews. Bob didn't wilt under her scrutiny, and finally she sighed. "I have no idea what you're talking about."<br><br>His cornflower Irish eyes leveled on her. "You haven't given up, Abigail. You won't toss in the towel on finding your husband's killer, ever."<br><br>"If you were in my position, would you give up?"<br><br>"We're not talking about me." He leaned in toward her.<br><br>"Something's happened. Something's changed. What?"<br><br>Abigail turned away from him. "Bob..."<br><br>He grunted, silencing her. "If you can't tell me what's really going on, you can't tell me. Just don't give me cleansing rituals."<br><br>"Okay, but the part about fixing up the house&#x2014;"<br><br>"That's a little better, as cover stories go."<br><br>"It's not a cover story&#x2014;"<br><br>"Abigail."<br><br>She decided not to push her luck, and Bob didn't press her further, scowling once more before heading back up to his third-floor apartment. Abigail watched her fire die out, here and there bits of unburned paper amid the ashes. She peeled the lid off her coffee can and noticed that she'd started to cry, almost as if she were someone else.<br><br>Using a long-handled spatula, she scooped ashes into the Folgers can.<br><br>Not all the ashes fit.<br><br>She stirred those left in the grill. All she needed to do was start a fire with two of Boston's most respected detectives on the premises. She'd been a detective for just two years. By Bob O'Reilly and Scoop Wisdom's standards&#x2014;by her own standards&#x2014;she was still a novice.<br><br>They believed in her, and she proved herself one day at a time, but she'd decided, even before she'd formed her own plan of action, not to tell them about last night's call.<br><br>An anonymous tip.<br><br>It wasn't the first in seven years, and it wasn't the craziest&#x2014;but she didn't need two trusted colleagues, two unwavering friends, to talk her out of following up on it.<br><br>Her spatula struck a half-burned page pasted to the bottom of the grill, the words jumping out of the ashes at her in thick, black marker, as if somehow she needed reminding.<br><br><em>I am a widow.</em><br><br></p><h2>Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)</h2><p>From the acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <b>Guilt</b> and <b>The 13th Juror</b> comes an electrifying new thriller--a novel in which San Francisco defense attorney Dismas Hardy faces the case of his career. This time his family is involved--and for Hardy, a devoted husband and father, the stakes have never been higher. <br><br>Dismas knows his wife, Frannie, is the most reliable of mothers. When she fails to pick up their children from school one afternoon, he's convinced something terrible has happened. It has: Frannie Hardy is in jail. Called before the grand jury in a murder investigation, she refused to reveal a secret entrusted to her by a man whose children attend the same school as hers, a friend who is accused of killing his wife. But now he has disappeared. Hardy knows there's only one way to get Frannie out of jail: clear her friend of murder. That is, if he can be found. <br><br>As he moves through a labyrinthine world of big business and San Francisco politics, looking for a man he half hopes never to find, a furious and frustrated Hardy is struggling to understand why his impeccably faithful wife is being so loyal to another man. What kind of truth could keep a wife from her husband, a mother from her children--could hold Hardy so powerless before the wrath of the law?<br><br>With an unparalleled ability to illuminate the complexities of relationships while weaving a story of breathtaking suspense, Lescroart has never been in finer form. And <b>Nothing But the Truth</b> is his finest hour.</p><p>Fans of John Lescroart's series hero Dismas Hardy, the thoughtful and likable San Francisco lawyer, will welcome this meditation on marriage served up as a murder mystery. In previous outings, Hardy has been a cop, a bartender, and even an assistant prosecutor, so he knows that, "Sometimes the whole truth is the last thing you want to hear." But then his wife Frannie goes to jail for refusing to tell what she knows about the husband of a murdered environmental activist. The Hardy's children are classmates of the victim's youngsters, and Dismas must confront the secrets in his own relationship that have been concealed by the all-too-familiar pressures of trying to balance work and love in the modern family. The plot, which involves oil, gas, ethanol, and gubernatorial politics, doesn't take center stage in this carefully written and deeply compelling novel; the real action is the series of revelations about the crime in question, which uncover the more interesting story of how even a good marriage can deteriorate despite--or perhaps because of--the daily work of trying to keep it going. Lescroart is in Scott Turow territory here, and he explores and conquers it with the same keen talent for describing the distance between private life and public trust. <i>Nothing But the Truth</i> represents a major step forward for Lescroart, who expands the mystery genre with every Dismas Hardy outing. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Praise for John Lescroart's previous novel, <b>The Mercy Rule</b>:<br><br>"A stylish whodunit . . . that finds Lescroart at his best."<br>--<i>People</i><br><br>"A terrific new novel from John Lescroart, who never wrote a bad page. You won't put it down."<br>--Larry King, <i>USA Today</i><br><br>"Lescroart has another winner. . . . A taut read."<br>--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"Very entertaining . . . a large and emotionally sprawling novel."<br>--<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Trial By Fire</h2><p>Caught by surprise when the government of Mexico is overthrown, the United States begins diplomatic negotiations with the country&#39;s new government, but attacks on civilians could force the U.S. into war. Reprint.</p><p>Hypothetical-war specialist Coyle (Bright Star, 1990; Sword Point, 1988) takes his recurring cast of characters to the Mexican border, where a coup d`&#x201a;tat to the south and the usual political bungling to the north make armed conflict inevitable. Thirteen army officers, fed up with decades of corruption and bungling under the ruling Revolutionary Party, have decapitated the Mexican government with one well-placed presidential plane crash. The Council of Thirteen, as they call themselves, speedily and rather brutally set about carving the rot from the Mexican political and governmental structure. The poor and the middle class love the new cleanliness; the druglords and the paid-for police hate it. The US, caught once again without useful intelligence, fails to understand the nature of the revolution and falls victim to manipulation by the druglords, who create chaos with terrorist acts on the border. The only American who seems to have the faintest idea of what's going on is TV reporter Jan Fields, whose good fortune has placed her in Mexico City at the time of the coup. As Fields's reports air, her lover, Lt. Col. Scott Dixon, heads with his troops for southern Texas, unhappily aware that he is about to take part in a war that can bring only pain and embarrassment to his country. Among his troops is Lt. Nancy Kozak, the Army's first female combat officer, who is about to find out what men have long known: war is extremely confusing and thoroughly interesting. Coyle has always been worth reading for his intelligent and authentic portrayals of the military messes we may find ourselves in before long. This time, he has sacrificed a little military detail for the sake of general readability. It's a sensible and worthwhile compromise. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Naipaul left his Caribbean birthplace at the age of seventeen, his improbable life has followed the global movement of peoples, whose preeminent literary chronicler he has become. In <i>The World Is What It Is,</i> Patrick French offers the first authoritative biography of the controversial Nobel laureate, whose only stated ambition was greatness as a writer, in pursuit of which goal nothing else was sacred.<br><br>Beginning with a richly detailed portrait of Naipaul&#x2019;s childhood in colonial Trinidad, French gives us the boy born to an Indian family, the displaced soul in a displaced community, who by dint of talent and ambition finds the only imaginable way out: a scholarship to Oxford. London in the 1950s offers hope and his first literary success, but homesickness and depression almost defeat Vidia, his narrow escape aided by Patricia Hale, an Englishwoman who will devote herself to his work and well-being. She will stand by him, sometimes tenuously, for more than four decades, even as Naipaul embarks on a twenty-four-year affair, which will awaken half-dead passions and feed perhaps his greatest wave of dizzying creativity. Amid this harrowing emotional life, French traces the course of the fierce visionary impulse underlying Naipaul&#x2019;s singular power, a gift to produce masterpieces of fiction and nonfiction.<br><br>Informed by exclusive access to V. S. Naipaul&#x2019;s private papers and personal recollections, and by great feeling for his formidable body of work, French&#x2019;s revelatory biography does full justice to an enigmatic genius.</p><p>Patrick French was born in England in 1966 and studied literature at Edinburgh University. He is the author of <i>Younghusband,</i> <i>Liberty or Death</i> and <i>Tibet, Tibet</i>, and is a winner of the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award, the Royal Society of Literature Heinemann Prize and the Somerset Maugham Award.The New World<br><br>The islands of the Caribbean dot and dash their way through the sea, linking different worlds. Central America joins the southern and northern hemispheres, taking you up through Colombia, Panama and Nicaragua by the land route until you reach Mexico, or down through the shallows of the Atlantic from Florida to the Bahamas, skirting Cuba and Jamaica, passing Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, until you find yourself in the sprayed arc of islands known as the Lesser Antilles, some no more than a few miles across: Anguilla, Sint Maarten, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, Martinique, Grenada. At the tip of the chain lies a larger island which, beneath the sea or geologically, is part of the South American mainland. Almost square, with a low promontory at its south-western corner pointing to Venezuela, this is Trinidad.<br><br>In the summer of 1498, three ships approached the shores of the island. The men on board were exhausted and burned by the sun, surviving off raisins, salt pork and sea biscuits, their supply of water running low. They were led by a white-haired voyager in his forties named Christoforo Colombo, known also as Christ�bal Col�n or Christopher Columbus. He was ill, his body inflamed and his eyes bleeding. It was Columbus&#x2019;s third voyage in search of Asia, and the one on which his future depended. A few months earlier, Vasco da Gama had reached Calicut, opening Europe&#x2019;s sea route to India. Renowned for his acute sense of smell, Columbus would have drunk in the lush, flowering vegetation of the island with its easy, humid, tropical climate, home to rainforests of bamboo and hardwood, flashing birds like the silver-beaked tanager, rivers, waterfalls and an array of caymans, snakes and beasts such as the nine-banded armadillo. There were no cocoa estates, no sugar-cane plantations, no breadfruit trees; Captain Bligh had yet to bring them from Tahiti. The only inhabitants were families of Amerindians who lived by farming and fishing, having paddled across the sea from the Orinoco river delta many centuries before.<br><br>Seeing three ranges of mountains running across the island, Columbus named it La Isla de la Trinidad after the Holy Trinity, in the Christian way. Later that day his sailors landed on the south coast to take on fresh water&#x2014;the moment of first contact. Over the following weeks they navigated neighbouring waters, and became the first Europeans to see the mainland of South America, the fresh green breast of the New World. Columbus suspected as he charted the wide mouth of the Orinoco river that he was on the edge of a continent rather than another island. With his health failing, he ordered his ships to sail north through the stretch of water between Trinidad and the mainland&#x2014;the Gulf of Paria&#x2014;until they reached the island of Margarita.<br><br>The outbreak of the sixteenth century brought adventurers to the island of Trinidad, who enslaved the indigenous Amerindians and sent them to work in Spanish colonies overseas. The old world disappeared: land was stolen, new settlements were made. The English, Dutch, French and Spanish all battled and schemed for supremacy in the islands of the West Indies. Using the legal formalities of the time, local chiefs lost their inheritance and power. Sir Walter Raleigh, an English marauder who raided Trinidad in 1595, found five desperate, dispossessed men in the custody of the Spaniards. They turned out to be &#x201c;the last aboriginal rulers of the land, held together on one chain, scalded with hot bacon fat, and broken by other punishments.&#x201d;<br><br>Nearly three centuries after the appearance of Columbus, Trinidad had barely been colonized. By 1783 it had 126 whites, 259 free coloureds, 310 African slaves and 2,032 Amerindians.3 To encourage settlement, King Charles III of Spain offered land and tax breaks. Roman Catholics of French descent moved from neighbouring islands, accompanied by their slaves, and started farming cocoa, tobacco, cotton and sugar. By 1797, when the Spanish surrendered Trinidad to the British during the French Revolutionary Wars, the population had risen to just under 18,000. In the nineteenth century, migrants flooded in, and by 1900 there were around 300,000 inhabitants. Unlike most other islands in the West Indies, the people of Trinidad came from many different places: there were Africans who spoke French creole or Yoruba, sailors and indentured labourers from China, neighbouring Venezuelans, German and French labourers, Syrian and Lebanese business families, wanderers from Grenada and Barbados, residual Amerindians, visitors from Madeira, demobbed black British army veterans, Portuguese and Spanish-speaking farmers of uncertain ethnicity and free slaves from the United States. Most Caribbean islands were homogenous by comparison, with white planters and black slaves, but Trinidad was uniquely and enduringly ethnically complex. Even its place names were various: Amerindian (Chaguanas), Spanish (San Fernando), French (Sans Souci) and British (Poole).<br><br>When slavery was formally abolished across the British empire in 1834 and cheap labour was needed for the sugar-cane plantations, malnourished Indians were shipped over from Calcutta and Madras. While the white planters of the West Indies had grown rich on sugar cane, their cousins in India had made fortunes from land revenues; and many beautiful houses were built in the English countryside. North India, under British control, was awash with dislocated, landless peasants. A voyage across the oceans and a stint as a bonded or indentured labourer was an alternative to destitution. In Trinidad, the newly arrived East Indians were nervous of the alien society in which they found themselves. They feared the island&#x2019;s black majority: Negroes seemed physically stronger, had rough manners and their dark skin identified them with the lower castes of Hinduism. The Negroes, for their part, came to regard these East Indians as heathens with peculiar customs who kept to themselves, were mean with money, cooked strange food and were servile to the plantation owners. Black agricultural labourers found their wages being undercut. They looked down on the Indians, who had to work long hours in the cane fields, as the &#x201c;new slaves.&#x201d;<br>Christmas 1894: Picture the tropical island of Trinidad with its sandy beaches, bursting coconuts, leaping howler monkeys and freshwater mangrove swamps teeming with scarlet ibis. A ship approaches Nelson Island, a parched limestone islet overlooking the capital, Port of Spain. The passengers who have survived the three-month sea voyage from Calcutta are loaded into open rowing boats. Quickly, the holding barrack is filled with men, women and children, their names recorded in a ledger under the supervision of a government official, the Protector of Immigrants. Their possessions are fumigated. They are housed, both sexes, in a long shed lined with wooden bunks filled with hay, infested with mosquitoes and sandflies. Most are Hindus, driven to flight by starvation or debt or trickery. All are desperate. They do not even know where they have come to; all they know is the name of the hot place to which they have been shipped, transposed into Hindi as &#x201c;Chinitat.&#x201d; Soon, an overseer will come from a plantation and indenture them as estate labourers, or coolies. The<i> Handbook of Trinidad </i>and <i>Tobago</i> states that when visiting the colony, &#x201c;Elaborate tropical outfits are not necessary . . . For ladies, the same clothes as would be worn during a hot English summer are suitable all the year round.&#x201d; Photographs of these new arrivals from India show them dressed almost in rags: a kurta and dhoti and light turban for the men, or a sari with the <i>pallu</i>, or tail, of the sari draped over the head in modesty for the women. These broken-down, thin-limbed immigrants with their tiny bundles of possessions can only have made the journey to Trinidad as a last resort.<br><br>One man among the many&#x2014;his name recorded as Kopil&#x2014;is a Brahmin, from a family of hereditary pundits in a village near Gorakhpur on the Nepalese border with India. He has pretended to be from a different background, since the recruiter back in India told him he might not be accepted as a labourer if he admits to being from the highest caste. For thirteen generations, Kopil&#x2019;s family have presided over the religious destiny of their neighbourhood, reading the Sanskrit texts and lecturing on spiritual practice to those who seek enlightenment. Wishing to study, he had walked south to Benares, the sacred Hindu city on the banks of the Ganges, where he met a recruiter who told him stories about the Caribbean, and how in this far-off place he would be given a gold coin each day as a reward for sifting sugar. If Kopil emigrated, he might even want to have a broad canvas belt made in which to store the gold coins. He is brought to a depot in Calcutta, and taken aboard the ship <i>Hereford.</i> At once, he feels his difference from the other immigrants. On board ship, he finds a piece of beef in his food. Although the voyage is terrible (forty people die from an outbreak of cholera, their corpses thrown overboard) Kopil starves himself for two days in horror at this contamination by cow meat, until the surgeon-superintendent intervenes and he is given a separate daily ration of raw potatoes and rice, which he cooks himself.<br><br>He reaches an island far from the large country and ancient civilization he has left behind. It is Kopil&#x2019;s misfortune to be indentured to Woodford Lodge in Chaguanas, an estate in central Trinidad where the regime is especially severe. Each morning, to preserve his caste identity, he sets his own pot of <i>khitchri</i>&#x2014;rice and spiced lentils&#x2014;on an earthen oven before going to work. Kopil is assigned to the shovel gang, to digging and planting. It breaks him. He is put on the weeding gang with the women and children, and later made responsible for clearing the dung from the animal pens, a sweeper&#x2019;s job. Kopil&#x2019;s health breaks.

Through Bascombe&#x2014;protean, funny, profane, wise, often inappropriate&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve witnessed the aspirations, sorrows, longings, achievements and failings of an American life in the twilight of the twentieth century.</p><p>Now, in <em>Let Me Be Frank with You</em>, Ford reinvents Bascombe in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In four richly luminous narratives, Bascombe (and Ford) attempts to reconcile, interpret and console a world undone by calamity. It is a moving and wondrous and extremely funny odyssey through the America we live in at this moment. Ford is here again working with the maturity and brilliance of a writer at the absolute height of his powers.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2014:</strong> It&#x2019;s been eight years since we last saw Frank Bascombe, successfully selling real estate in New Jersey, easing into his mid-50s at the conclusion of Richard Ford&#x2019;s celebrated trilogy (<i>The Sportswriter</i>, <i>Independence Day</i>, and <i>The Lay of the Land</i>). Ford clearly had more to say about his man Frank. In the four connected novellas that comprise the touching and humorous <i>Let Me Be Frank With You</i> &#x2014;like a coda to the trilogy&#x2014;we see Frank confronting his aging self and, at the same time, a New Jersey coastline recently ravaged by Hurricane Sandy. In some ways, he&#x2019;s the same old Frank: an admitted &#x201c;malcontent,&#x201d; cranky and kvetching, but funny and, mostly, a good guy. Speaking of being frank, I must admit: as a fan of the trilogy (especially the first two), I was doubtful that I&#x2019;d care about the first-world problems of rich and retired Frank Bascombe, now on the verge of 70. But there&#x2019;s a creeping sadness that infuses these stories, and a little bit of rage, as in raging against the dying light. Frank is successful, but he doesn&#x2019;t seem all that satisfied. Friendship is overrated, he claims. &#x201c;None of us... are really designed to have that many friends.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s touching and at times moving to watch Frank both resist and acknowledge &#x201c;death&#x2019;s processional onset ... the final, thrilling dips of the roller coaster.&#x201d; In the end, the ride of life is often a waiting game. Says Frank: &#x201c;Time fixes things, mostly.&#x201d; <i>--Neal Thompson</i></p><p>A brilliant new work that returns Richard Ford to the celebrated fictional landscape that sealed his reputation as an American master: the world of Frank Bascombe</p><p>In his trio of critically acclaimed, bestselling novels&#x2014;<em>The Sportswriter</em>, the Pulitzer Prize and PEN/ Faulkner-winning <em>Independence Day</em>, and <em>The Lay of the Land</em>&#x2014;Richard Ford, in essence, illuminated the zeitgeist of an entire generation, through the divinings and wit of his now-famous literary chronicler, Frank Bascombe, who is certainly one of the most indelible, provocative, and anticipated characters in modern American literature.</p><p>Here, in <em>Let Me Be Frank With You</em>, Ford returns with four deftly linked stories narrated by the iconic Bascombe. Now sixty-eight, and again ensconced in the well-defended New Jersey suburb of Haddam, Bascombe has thrived&#x2014;seemingly if not utterly&#x2014;in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy's devastation. As in all of the Bascombe books, Ford's guiding spirit is the old comic's maxim that promises if nothing's funny, nothing's truly serious. The desolation of Sandy, which rendered houses, shorelines, and countless lives unmoored and flattened, could scarcely be more serious as the grist for fiction. Yet it is the perfect backdrop and touchstone for Ford&#x2014;and Bascombe. With a flawless comedic sensibility and unblinking intelligence, these stories range over the full complement of American subjects: aging, race, loss, faith, marriage, redemption, the real-estate crash&#x2014;the tumult of the world we live in.</p><p>Through Bascombe&#x2014;wry, profane, touching, wise, and often inappropriate&#x2014;we engage in the aspirations and sorrows, longings, achievements, and failings of American life in the morning of the new century. With his trademark candor and brimming wit, Richard Ford brings Bascombe fully back, in all his imperfect glory, to say (often hilariously) what all of us are thinking but few will voice aloud.</p><p>Whether you've been a Bascombe insider since <em>The Sportswriter</em> or are encountering Ford's unforgettable inventions newly here, <em>Let Me Be Frank With You</em> is a moving, wondrous, extremely funny odyssey, showcasing the maturity and brilliance of a great writer working at the top of his talents. </p></p><h2>Back in the Fight: The Explosive Memoir of a Special Operator Who Never Gave Up</h2><p><p><b>The inspiring and thrilling combat memoir of the only Army Ranger serving in direct combat operations with a prosthetic limb.</b></p><p>On October 3, 2005, Kapacziewski and his soldiers were coming to the end of their tour in Northern Iraq when their convoy was attacked by enemy fighters. A grenade fell through the gunner's hatch and exploded, shattering Kapacziewski's right leg below the knee, damaging his right hip, and severing a nerve and artery in his right arm.</p><p>He endured more than forty surgeries, but his right leg still wasn't healing as he had hoped, so in March 2007, Kapacziewski chose to have it amputated with one goal in mind: to return to the line and serve alongside his fellow Rangers. One year after his surgery, Kapacziewski accomplished his goal: he was put back on the line, as a squad leader of his Army Ranger Regiment.</p><p>On April 19, 2010, during his ninth combat deployment (and fifth after losing his leg), Kapacziewski's patrol ran into an ambush outside a village in eastern Afghanistan. After a fellow Ranger fell to withering enemy fire, shot through the belly, Sergeant Kap and another soldier dragged him seventy-five yards to safety and administered first aid that saved his life while heavy machineguns tried to kill them. His actions earned him an Army Commendation Medal with "V" for Valor. He had previously been awarded a Bronze Star for Valor&#x2015;and a total of three Purple Hearts for combat wounds.</p><p><i>Back in the Fight</i> is an inspiring and thrilling tale readers will never forget.</p></p><p><p>SFC JOE KAPACZIEWSKI is the only amputee in Army Rangers history to return to combat, serving nine tours in the Middle East. On May 24, 2011, he became the first enlisted soldier ever to receive the No Greater Sacrifice Freedom Award, given to individuals who epitomize selfless service to the nation. Since losing his leg, he has completed three triathlons and finished the New York Marathon twice. When not deployed to war zones, he often visits wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Center and Brooke Army Hospital in San Antonio.</p><p>CHARLES W.

He lives in Oklahoma.</p>1 <br>AFGHANISTAN 2009 <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>If there was one thing U.S. Army Rangers were good at&#x2014;other than killing terrorists who needed killing&#x2014;it was walking long distances with obscene weight on our backs. Busting balls, in soldier jargon. At altitudes of 10,000 feet, 65 pounds of kit was murder, but necessary gear for modern, <i>safe</i> warfare&#x2014;Kevlar helmet, &#x201c;bulletproof&#x201d; jacket with Kevlar plates, weapons, desert boots, ammo, radio, NODs (night optical devices), MREs (Meals, Ready to Eat; chow)&#x2014;and you were toting some real weight. <br>Nothing could bust balls like the Hindu Kush Mountains along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Just ask the Russians who had been here. It was Taliban country. A hardy breed, the Taliban were, just as cunning at fighting in the mountains as the Apaches had been in the deserts of Arizona and Mexico. They fought lightweight, too. Give a Taliban a rifle, a baggy pair of shepherd&#x2019;s trousers, a handful of dried mutton and another of cartridges, and he was ready to run through these mountains like a goat. Up here, the Taliban claimed the advantage. After all, Afghans had been defending this land for generations. In these mountains, you were always behind enemy lines. <br>For the past two months, Alpha Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th U.S. Army Ranger Regiment had been beating these mountains for enemy training camps and HVTs. An HVT was a &#x201c;high-value target,&#x201d; usually someone in a leadership position with the Taliban or al Qaeda whose only purpose in life was to kill Americans. By that definition, every mother&#x2019;s son south and east of FOB (forward operating base) Salerno was an HVT. Our job was to kill them first. When we could find them. <br>Intel advised of an enemy training camp up here, protected in some almost-inaccessible nook or cranny. Alpha Company had two platoons out looking for it in movement to contact. My platoon, the 1st, had been humping hard in the dark for the past four hours, wending our way upward toward the summit of the Khost-Gardez Pass, better known from ancient times as &#x201c;the Death Pass&#x201d; for reasons best left unconsidered. <br>It was cool at this altitude, but I was damp from the skin out from sweating as the platoon gained elevation, climbing immense verticals, banging against boulders, squeezing through holes barely big enough for a rabbit, and worming through spine-twisting avalanche slag as we sucked for oxygen in the thin air. <br>&#x201c;How does he do it?&#x201d; I overheard one of the new privates whisper wearily during a take-five. &#x201c;My ass is dragging and he just keeps going and going like the Energizer Bunny. Well, you know, what with everything&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sergeant Kap is hardcore,&#x201d; came the response. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let him hear you talking about it.&#x201d; <br>As far as I was concerned, I, Staff Sergeant Joe Kapacziewski, Third Squad Leader, 1st Platoon, was an Army Ranger like any other ball-busting grunt in this man&#x2019;s outfit. <br>A fogbank silver in the wan moonlight slithered through the valley below K-G Pass as 1st Platoon approached the top. I thought it a spectacular sight. Moonlight glinted off mountain peaks while sheening opaque off the fog in the valley. Then the moon ducked back out of sight in the higher clouds, and it was as dark again as your crotch at midnight. We would have been blind in the dark save for NODs providing a liquid, greenish view. <br>In the valley below, beneath the fog, Alpha Two maintained radio contact in order to parallel Alpha One on the high ground. In this terrain, there was no way we could support each other if one of the platoons ran into a shit storm. <br>My 1st Platoon moved in two elements, the rearmost overwatching the point element ahead as we cautiously approached a ridgeline that dropped steeply off on the other side from Gardez Province into Khost Province. First Squad leader Joe Edwards, a country boy from Georgia and an implant from the regular army, led the first element. He was one of my best team leaders at one point, now he was one of the best Squad Leaders in A Company. Second Squad trailed behind him with the CP (command post) element and attachments. I and my boys in Third Squad brought up the tail of the formation. <br>Infantry tactics had changed little in more than a century. Even in an age of unmanned drones in the sky and robots in the field, what war came down to was still opposing bands of soldiers on the ground shooting at each other. Only the geography changed. Sergeant First Class Soroken insisted that wars starting from World War II were actually one continuous war with occasional breaks to rearm and bury the dead. <br> <i>This was prime geography for an ambush.</i> <br>That thought passed through my mind like some kind of primal instinct. Like you had this feeling something was about to happen&#x2014;and then it did. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The ridgeline directly ahead suddenly lit up with a twinkling of muzzle flashes and the fierce crackle of rifle fire as Edwards&#x2019;s lead element triggered the ambush waiting for us. Green tracer rounds streaked into our front like supersonic fireflies. Edwards and his boys immediately opened up to establish fire superiority, the protocol for a near ambush. The deep-throated cracking of enemy AK-47s counterpointed the thinner, more spiteful popping of M-4s and grenades exploding. PL (platoon leader) Captain Charlie Felker, a huge officer from St. Louis, got on the radio and started calling for fire. <br>The ambushers were dug in at the ridge, looking right down our throats. My squad hit the dirt with the first sound of guns. In a situation like this, the lead element kept the bad guys busy while the trail element maneuvered. Unfortunately, we had little maneuver room. The terrain was nasty: rock ledges, loose shale, and stunted brush. <br>Sergeant Soroken moved forward and offset to get a clear shot at the ambush past the PL and his element. I yelled at my squad. We scrambled even farther to the right flank and took cover behind a low ledge. Damn! All that <i>safe</i> soldier gear exhausted your ass with its weight when you had to rush around to get to higher ground. <br>We possessed NODs. The Taliban didn&#x2019;t. Their night vision might have been better than ours, but no naked eyes were keen enough to hold a good, accurate firefight in the dark. We held the advantage there. Although bright muzzle flashes flared through the devices, almost blindingly so, the goggles still provided greenish shadows of movement on the ridge less than 200 meters away. We tapped off a few rounds every time we spotted movement. Slinging lead. <br>I heard Sergeant Soroken on the radio with PacMan One-Three, the call sign for either a patroling aircraft or a Predator drone appointed as an angel in the sky to overlook ground pounders. Wes was trying to get the aircraft to &#x201c;sparkle&#x201d; targets with his infrared (IR) marking laser, lighting them up for the IR sensors in our NODs to detect. PacMan kept sparkling us instead. A sharp exchange ensued. <br> <i>&#x201c;PacMan, you&#x2019;re getting us&#x2026;&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s negative, Alpha One&#x2026;&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on us again&#x2026;&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re moving, Alpha One&#x2026;&#x201d;</i> <br>Other things were starting to happen. <br> <i>&#x201c;We got a couple of squirters headed down back of the ridge,&#x201d;</i> the platoon sergeant radioed, as calm as if he were back at Fort Benning buying a round of beers for the boys at Coach&#x2019;s Corner. One cool dude under pressure. <i>&#x201c;They might be trying to flank us.&#x201d;</i> <br>I volunteered to take care of them. I tapped Smith, Housner, Timmy Bowman, and a new private from my squad. All hard chargers. <br>&#x201c;Follow me.&#x201d; <br>The incline was about 45 degrees. NODs helped us avoid most of the bad shit as we scrambled down the other side of the ridge. Firing ceased at the ambush site. It would pick up again if the other side got a machine gun placed farther down the ridge with which to rake our flank. <br>I dropped on my belly at the military crest and crawled up to look over the top, my Rangers with me. It was pitch black looking down the other side. Even with NODs, I barely made out more rock ledges and some stunted brush. I heard movement down there somewhere in the dark, scuffing sounds of soft-soled shoes or sandals on shale and rock. Even Apaches made <i>some</i> noise in this kind of country. <br>Sergeant Soroken was still on the radio with PacMan, who insisted he had his sparkle on the bad guys and not on us. I realized he was right. He <i>was</i> on the bad guys, but they were so near that <i>we</i> were part of his target. <br>I spotted shadows flitting fast through the brush and rocks, climbing in an oblique run toward the crest farther down. I jumped up and led the way paralleling the squirters, hoping to cut them off and get a shot. <br>Loose shale unexpectedly gave way beneath my boots. My feet flew out from under me, and my ass hit the ground hard. Next thing I knew I was the centerpiece of a miniavalanche blasting downhill at about Mach 1. Everything I grabbed at to stop my rapid descent ripped free and became part of the slide. I pictured myself hurtling over a precipice into the fog of the valley a few thousand feet down. <br>I spotted a small tree clinging to the side of the mountain about 25 feet ahead. I tried to wrench myself toward it, clutching my rifle in one hand and reaching for the tree with the other.

Pearl Harbor is the definitive illustrated account of that momentous day. No other battle of the Pacific War was better documented in photographs than was Pearl Harbor. Everyone has seen some of these images, but few are aware of just how many there are-including many that have never been published. Official government photographers were busy that morning, but so were countless service personnel and shocked civilians. Even the Japanese navy photographed their preparations and the launch of the attack fleet. The visual record of the day includes not just stunning black-and-white shots but also vivid color photos showing the American fleet under attack and burning. Pearl Harbor makes lavish use of these historical photos to vividly re-create what it felt like to be there during every key moment of the battle. A compelling narrative by noted naval historian Dan Van der Vat explains the causes and background of the attack. Moving first-person reminiscences of persons who were there-Japanese and Americans, military and civilians, adults and children-give the pictures even greater immediacy.</p><p>Dan Van Der Vat has written extensively on the sea and World War II, in such books as Stealth at Sea: The History of the Submarine and The Good Nazi: The Life and Lies of Albert Speer. His book, The Pacific Campaign is one of the liveliest and best general histories of the Japanese-American conflict during World War II.Introduction by Senator John McCain <p>The past few years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in what has popularly been called the last great war. Films like Saving Private Ryan and books like Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation and James Bradley and Ron Powers' Flags of our Fathers have played an instrumental role in reminding the public of a period that saw the United States mobilized toward a single purpose like no other time in its history - the defeat of fascism in Europe and of Japanese hegemony in Asia. </p><p>The divisions in our society that existed in the period leading up to the Japanese attack on US forces at Pearl Harbor tend to be forgotten. Our collective memory appropriately takes pride in our achievements once mobilized for war. The book that follows, however, will serve as a reminder that the United States - the country that emerged from World War II the most powerful nation in history - entered the war unprepared and riven with internal divisions regarding our place in the world and a vision of where we wanted to go. It is an illustrated history. Its intention is to educate through narrative, pictorial history, and paintings inspired by the events discussed. </p><p>And those events changed the course of world history. The architect of Japan's bold stroke against American naval forces at Pearl Harbor, the respected Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, harbored few illusions regarding the nature of the country he was ordered to attack. Well versed in American culture and industrial capacity, Admiral Yamamoto prophetically proclaimed, upon receiving word of his magnificent victory at Pearl Harbor: "We have awakened a sleeping giant and have instilled in him a terrible resolve." The admiral's eventual death at the hands of American fighter pilots constituted an exclamation mark on his fateful prediction. Galvanized as a nation, the American people responded with a war effort that would take them to victory in the Pacific as Allied forces similarly drove to Berlin. </p><p>Both my grandfather and father fought in World War II. My grandfather stood on the deck of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay to witness the signing by the Japanese of the documents of surrender. In between the events at Pearl Harbor and that moment aboard the Missouri, the world, and the United States in particular, underwent a monumental transformation. Vicious battles under the most terrible conditions were the norm in the Pacific Theater. From Bougainvillaea to Corrigedor to Hiroshima, the United States avenged its humiliation and loss at Pearl Harbor with a tenacity and courage that should never be permitted to fade from our memory. </p><p>Ten years after the Persian Gulf War, I continue to marvel at the scale of that military victory and at the blessedly low number of American dead. It has become too easy to forget the sacrifices of an earlier generation in the struggle to rid the world of tyranny - a struggle manifest not just during World War II, but in Korea and Indochina as well. Twenty-four hundred American servicemen were killed at Pearl Harbor, a tragic prelude to the tens of thousands more who would perish in places few knew existed the day before the first bombs fell on Battleship Row. </p><p>Off Ford Island in Hawaii is the memorial to the USS Arizona, a ship named for the state I am honored to represent in Congress. Parts of its structure emerge from the waters of the bay like a cast-iron headstone. The Arizona remains the final resting place for 1,100 of its crew. Sixty years after Japanese bombs sent it to its watery grave, it continues to stand as a silent testament to the sacrifice of so many in defense of liberty. It also serves to remind us of the need to remain vigilant. </p><p>Dan van der Vat's book is an important contribution to the literature about the events leading up to World War II and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He has performed an admirable service by combining concise yet insightful narrative with a wealth of photographs and paintings in telling the story of what President Roosevelt famously termed in the attack's aftermath, "a day that will live in infamy." With each visit to the USS Arizona Memorial, I am compelled to reflect again on the tragedy that befell the men and women who perished in the attack on Pearl Harbor, and on those who died thousands of miles from home in the war that followed. In the caption accompanying one of the photographs, van der Vat quotes an officer serving aboard the Arizona the day before the Japanese attack. "By this time next week," Captain Frank Valkenburgh wrote, "we will be on our way home for Christmas." Nothing more need be said.</p></p><h2>Planets in Play: How to Reimagine Your Life Through the Language of Astrology</h2><p>Reveals how to enable positive changes by embracing latent zodiac traits while diminishing less desirable ones, in an astrology-based resource that makes practical recommendations for adjusting one&#39;s character aspects in healthy and transforming ways.

Since entries are listed by the name the rose was given when introduced, there are numerous cross-references to point users to the correct entry. For example, the <i>Peace</i> rose is found under its breeder name of <i>Mme. A. Meilland.</i> <p>Eighty-nine roses are highlighted in special entry boxes where the parent plant and its sports (mutations) are shown together. More than 40 feature panels profile nurseries, rose growers, and famous rose gardens from around the world. There are sections on cultivating roses, a glossary, a species index, a directory of rose societies throughout the world, a list of Web sites, and a very short general index. </p><p>The book is lacking in only a few types of information that would have assisted users. Since most gardeners choose roses by color, a color index would be helpful. Similarly, multiple indexes would aid patrons looking for a particular type of rose, such as a climbing rose or a rose with certain properties, such as fragrance or resistance to disease. Some additional cross-references would help with American names of foreign roses such as New Zealand's <i>Land of the Long White Cloud</i> (known as <i>Full Sail</i> in the U.S.).</p><p>These lapses aside, this is an excellent resource about roses. It will delight gardeners whether they wish to find information or merely browse and is highly recommended for both public and academic libraries. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She retraces the pioneer journey of the Ingalls family- looking for the Big Woods among the medium trees in Wisconsin, wading in Plum Creek, and enduring a prairie hailstorm in South Dakota. She immerses herself in all things <i>Little House,</i> and explores the story from fact to fiction, and from the TV shows to the annual summer pageants in Laura's hometowns. Whether she's churning butter in her apartment or sitting in a replica log cabin, McClure is always in pursuit of "the Laura experience." Along the way she comes to understand how Wilder's life and work have shaped our ideas about girlhood and the American West. <br><br> <i>The Wilder Life</i> is a loving, irreverent, spirited tribute to a series of books that have inspired generations of American women. It is also an incredibly funny first-person account of obsessive reading, and a story about what happens when we reconnect with our childhood touchstones-and find that our old love has only deepened.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Gretchen Rubin Interviews Wendy McClure</strong> <p> Gretchen Rubin started her career as a lawyer, and she was clerking for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor when she realised she really wanted to be a writer. She lives in New York City with her husband and two young daughters. Rubin is the author of several books, including <em>The Happiness Project</em>. </p> <p> <strong>Gretchen:</strong> If you had to pick the one scene from all of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s books that makes you the happiest, what would it be? I'd pick the scene where Mr. Edwards brings back the Christmas gifts to Laura and Mary, after he meets Santa Claus in Independence. I cry every time! Or maybe when Laura tells Almanzo that she won't go buggy-riding with Nellie Oleson again. </p> <p> <strong>Wendy:</strong> For me it&#x2019;s when the Ingalls family moves into the &#x201c;wonderful house&#x201d; in <em>On the Banks of Plum Creek</em>. The rooms are clean and new, with store-boughten hinges and china knobs on the doors, and everything is in its place. Every time I read it, I swoon over the details, from the calico-edged curtains to the smell of the pine boards. A close second is the scene where Laura gets to see the surveyors&#x2019; house for the first time in <em>By the Shores of Silver Lake</em>. </p> <p> <strong>Gretchen:</strong> Why do you think the Little House books have meant so much to you for so long? </p> <p> <strong>Wendy:</strong> I think it&#x2019;s because the point of view is at once so subtle and vivid that it feels like I&#x2019;m in Laura Ingalls&#x2019;s head, looking with her eyes. I learned so much about how to see from these books, which in turn helped me learn to observe and think like a writer. </p> <p> <strong>Gretchen:</strong> Now that you've had all those adventures and written your own book about LIW, do you feel differently about Wilder and the books? </p> <p> <strong>Wendy:</strong> In some ways, yes. I&#x2019;m able to separate the real Laura Ingalls Wilder from her fictional counterpart and see her in ways that my childhood vision of her didn&#x2019;t allow for. I also now see Laura&#x2019;s daughter, Rose, as part of the books because she contributed so much to them. At the same time, the world of the books hasn&#x2019;t changed much in my mind. Even when I&#x2019;ve seen the actual sites where the books take place, my imagined version of those places is just as real to me as it&#x2019;s always been. </p> <p> <strong>Gretchen:</strong> Having written <em>The Wilder Life</em>, you must be approached constantly by people who are also ardent Laura Ingalls Wilder fans. Do you feel an instant connection to them, or is it a bit hard to relate to everyone's strong emotions about her work? </p> <p> <strong>Wendy:</strong> I feel more connected to other fans much more than I ever did when I was younger. As a kid, my relationship to Laura and the books was so solitary&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t really know anyone else who loved the books. So when I started to meet and talk to others about the book, it took a little getting used to at first, because everyone&#x2019;s fandom is different (some people really love the TV show, others consider it sacrilege); but I&#x2019;ve since found that one of the best things about writing this book is being able to take part in this shared passion. </p> <p> <strong>Gretchen:</strong> How in the world do you come up with those hilarious Twitter comments as @HalfPintIngalls? Brilliant. My favorite so far: "Hey Almanzo, if you liked it then you should&#x2019;ve built a shanty on it." </p> <p> <strong>Wendy:</strong> It takes longer than you&#x2019;d think! I try to take advantage of the seasons and think, what would Laura be tweeting about this time of year? (Thanks to <em>The Long Winter</em>, it&#x2019;s never too early or late in the year to complain about twisting hay!) I also go through the Little House books in search of inspiration. It helps that HalfPintIngalls doesn&#x2019;t tweet too much...after all, she has to walk two miles into town to send her posts from the Twittergraph office! </p>Wendy McClure holds an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers' Workshop.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 3-5&#x2013;Ten-year-old Elizabeth Cole lives in Williamsburg in 1775. She and her friend Felicity Merriman (from the Felicity books in the American Girl series) delight in teasing Elizabeths proper, but boy-crazed, 16-year-old sister, Annabelle. The pranks backfire, leading to the threat that Elizabeth will be taken to England when Annabelle marries Lord Harry Lacey. In protest, she concentrates her mischief on prissy Miss Priscilla, Harrys domineering sister. This inspires mild-mannered Harry to stand up for himself, prompting Annabelle to show a glimpse of spine, too. The book includes six pages of illustrated historical data on Courtship and Marriage in 1775. Elizabeth and Felicity are charming, well drawn, and appealing. Except for Priscilla and Harry, secondary characters are paper-doll thin. Annabelle may rise to pasteboard depth, but before the story concludes, readers find her reverting to her old ways. The book is long on historical contextual detail, and the style is highly accessible without attempting to re-create historical dialogue.<i>&#x2013;Marlene Johnson, Paradise Education Center, Surprise, AZ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taking on the myths and misconceptions along with the outsized reality, he portrays - with characteristic wit and passion-a man of multiple contradictions, contagious bravery, breath-taking eloquence, matchless strategizing, and deep humanity. Fearless on the battlefield, Churchill had to be ordered by the King to stay out of action on D-Day; he embraced large-scale strategic bombing, yet hated the destruction of war and scorned politicians who had not experienced its horrors. He was a celebrated journalist, a great orator and won the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was famous for his ability to combine wining and dining with many late nights of crucial wartime decision-making. His open-mindedness made him a pioneer in health care, education, and social welfare, though he remained incorrigibly politically incorrect. Most of all, as Boris Johnson says, &#39;Churchill is the resounding human rebuttal to all who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces&#39;. THE CHURCHILL FACTOR is a book to be enjoyed not only by anyone interested in history: it is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what makes a great leader.</p><p>Boris Johnson was elected Mayor of London in May 2008. Before this he was the Editor of the Spectator, Member of Parliament for Henley on Thames, Shadow Minister for the Arts and Shadow Minister for Higher Education. He is the author of many books, notably Johnson&#39;s Life of London (re-issued as The Spirit of London), Have I Got Views for You and Dream of Rome.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>A DOG CALLED CHURCHILL</p><p>When I was growing up, there was no doubt about it. Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced. From a very early age I had a pretty clear idea of what he had done: he had led my country to victory against all the odds and against one of the most disgusting tyrannies the world has seen.</p><p>I knew the essentials of his story. My brother Leo and I used to pore over Martin Gilbert&#x2019;s biographical Life in Pictures, to the point where we had memorised the captions.</p><p>I knew that he had a mastery of the art of speech-making, and my father (like many of our fathers) would recite some of his most famous lines; and I knew, even then, that this art was dying out. I knew that he was funny, and irreverent, and that even by the standards of his time he was politically incorrect.</p><p>At suppertime we were told the apocryphal stories: the one where Churchill is on the lavatory, and informed that the Lord Privy Seal wants to see him, and he says that he is sealed in the privy, etc. We knew the one where Socialist MP Bessie Braddock allegedly told him that he was drunk, and he replied, with astonishing rudeness, that she was ugly and he would be sober in the morning.</p><p>I think we also dimly knew the one about the Tory minister and the guardsman . . . You probably know it, but never mind. I had the canonical version the other day from Sir Nicholas Soames, his grandson, over lunch at the Savoy.</p><p>Even allowing for Soames&#x2019;s brilliance in storytelling, it has the ring of truth&#x2014;and tells us something about a key theme of this book: the greatness of Churchill&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>&#x2018;One of his Conservative ministers was a bugger, if you see what I mean . . .&#x2019; (said Soames, loudly enough for most of the Grill Room to hear) &#x2018;. . . though he was also a great friend of my grandfather. He was always getting caught, but of course in those days the press weren&#x2019;t everywhere, and nobody said anything. One day he pushed his luck because he was caught rogering a Guardsman on a bench in Hyde Park at three in the morning&#x2014;and it was February, by the way.</p><p>&#x2018;This was immediately reported to the Chief Whip, who rang Jock Colville, my grandfather&#x2019;s Private Secretary.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Jock,&#x201d; said the Chief Whip, &#x201c;I am afraid I have some very bad news about so-and-so. It&#x2019;s the usual thing, but the press have got it and it&#x2019;s bound to come out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; said Colville.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;I really think I should come down and tell the Prime Minister in person.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Yes, I suppose you should.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;So the Chief Whip came down to Chartwell [Churchill&#x2019;s home in Kent], and he walked into my grandfather&#x2019;s study, where he was working at his upright desk. &#x201c;Yes, Chief Whip,&#x201d; he said, half turning round, &#x201c;how can I help you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;The Chief Whip explained the unhappy situation. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll have to go,&#x201d; he concluded.</p><p>&#x2018;There was a long pause, while Churchill puffed his cigar. Then he said: &#x201c;Did I hear you correctly in saying that so-and-so has been caught with a Guardsman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Yes, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;In Hyde Park?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;Yes, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;On a park bench?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;At three o&#x2019;clock in the morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct, Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201c;In this weather! Good God, man, it makes you proud to be British!&#x201d;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I KNEW THAT he had been amazingly brave as a young man, and that he had killed men with his own hand, and been fired at on four continents, and that he was one of the first men to go up in an aeroplane. I knew that he had been a bit of a runt at Harrow, and that he was only about 5 feet 7 and with a 31-inch chest, and that he had overcome his stammer and his depression and his appalling father to become the greatest living Englishman.</p><p>I gathered that there was something holy and magical about him, because my grandparents kept the front page of the Daily Express from the day he died, at the age of ninety. I was pleased to have been born a year before: the more I read about him, the more proud I was to have been alive when he was alive. So it seems all the more sad and strange that today&#x2014;nearly fifty years after he died&#x2014;he is in danger of being forgotten, or at least imperfectly remembered.</p><p>The other day I was buying a cigar at an airport in a Middle Eastern country that had probably been designed by Churchill. I noticed that the cigar was called a San Antonio Churchill, and I asked the vendor at the Duty-Free whether he knew who Churchill was. He read the name carefully and I pronounced it for him.</p><p>&#x2018;Shursheel?&#x2019; he said, looking blank.</p><p>&#x2018;In the war,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;the Second World War.&#x2019;</p><p>Then he looked as though the dimmest, faintest bell was clanking at the back of his memory.</p><p>&#x2018;An old leader?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Yes, maybe, I think. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x2019; He shrugged.</p><p>Well, he is doing no worse than many kids today. Those who pay attention in class are under the impression that he was the guy who fought Hitler to rescue the Jews. But most young people&#x2014;according to a recent survey&#x2014;think that Churchill is the dog in a British insurance advertisement.</p><p>That strikes me as a shame, because he is so obviously a character that should appeal to young people today. He was eccentric, over the top, camp, with his own special trademark clothes&#x2014;and a thoroughgoing genius.</p><p>I want to try to convey some of that genius to those who might not be fully conscious of it, or who have forgotten it&#x2014;and I am of course aware that this is a bit of a cheek.</p><p>I am not a professional historian, and as a politician I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his shoes, or even the shoes of Roy Jenkins, who did a superb one-volume biography; and as a student of Churchill I sit at the feet of Martin Gilbert, Andrew Roberts, Max Hastings, Richard Toye and many others.</p><p>I am conscious that there are a hundred books a year on our hero&#x2014;and yet I am sure it is time for a new assessment, because we cannot take his reputation for granted. The soldiers of the Second World War are gradually fading away. We are losing those who can remember the sound of his voice, and I worry that we are in danger&#x2014;through sheer vagueness&#x2014;of forgetting the scale of what he did.</p><p>These days we dimly believe that the Second World War was won with Russian blood and American money; and though that is in some ways true, it is also true that, without Churchill, Hitler would almost certainly have won.</p><p>What I mean is that Nazi gains in Europe might well have been irreversible. We rightly moan today about the deficiencies of the European Union&#x2014;and yet we have forgotten about the sheer horror of that all too possible of possible worlds.</p><p>We need to remember it today, and we need to remember the ways in which this British Prime Minister helped to make the world we still live in. Across the globe&#x2014;from Europe to Russia to Africa to the Middle East&#x2014;we see traces of his shaping mind.</p><p>Churchill matters today because he saved our civilisation. And the important point is that only he could have done it.</p><p>He is the resounding human rebuttal to all Marxist historians who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces. The point of the Churchill Factor is that one man can make all the difference.</p><p>Time and again in his seven decades in public life we can see the impact of his personality on the world, and on events&#x2014;far more of them than are now widely remembered.</p><p>He was crucial to the beginning of the welfare state in the early 1900s. He helped give British workers job centres and the tea break and unemployment insurance. He invented the RAF and the tank and he was absolutely critical to the action&#x2014;and Britain&#x2019;s eventual victory&#x2014;in the First World War. He was indispensable to the foundation of Israel (and other countries), not to mention the campaign for a united Europe.</p><p>At several moments he was the beaver who dammed the flow of events; and never did he affect the course of history more profoundly than in 1940.</p><p>Character is destiny, said the Greeks, and I agree. If that is so, then the deeper and more fascinating question is what makes up the character.</p><p>What were the elements that made him capable of filling that gigantic role? In what smithies did they forge that razor mind and iron will?</p><p>What the hammer, what the chain, in what furnace was his brain? as William Blake almost puts it. That&#x2019;s the question.</p><p>But first let&#x2019;s try and agree on what he did.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p>THE OFFER FROM HITLER</p><p>If you are looking for one of the decisive moments in the last world war, and a turning-point in the history of the world, then come with me. Let us go to a dingy room in the House of Commons&#x2014;up some steps, through a creaky old door, down a dimly lit corridor; and here it is.</p><p>You won&#x2019;t find it on the maps of the Palace of Westminster, for obvious security reasons; and you can&#x2019;t normally get the guides to show you. In fact the precise room I am talking about doesn&#x2019;t really exist any more, since it was blown up in the Blitz; but the replacement is faithful enough to the original.</p><p>It is one of the rooms used by the Prime Minister when he or she wants to meet colleagues in the Commons, and you don&#x2019;t need to know much about the decor, because it is predictable.</p><p>Think of loads of green leather, and brass studs, and heavy coarse-grained oak panelling and Pugin wallpaper and a few prints, slightly squiffily hung. And think smoke&#x2014;because we are talking about the afternoon of 28 May 1940, and in those days many politicians&#x2014;including our subject&#x2014;were indefatigable consumers of tobacco.</p><p>It is safe to assume there wasn&#x2019;t much daylight getting through the mullioned windows, but most members of the public would easily have been able to recognise the main characters. There were seven of them in all, and they were the War Cabinet of Britain.</p><p>It is a measure of the depth of their crisis that they had been meeting almost solidly for three days. This was their ninth meeting since 26 May, and they had yet to come up with an answer to the existential question that faced them and the world.</p><p>In the chair was the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. On one side was Neville Chamberlain, the high-collared, stiff-necked and toothbrush-moustached ex&#x2013;Prime Minister, and the man Churchill had unceremoniously replaced. Rightly or wrongly, Chamberlain was blamed for fatally underestimating the Hitler menace, and for the failure of appeasement. When the Nazis had bundled Britain out of Norway earlier that month, it was Chamberlain who took the rap.</p><p>Then there was Lord Halifax, the tall, cadaverous Foreign Secretary who had been born with a withered left hand that he concealed in a black glove. There was Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the Liberal Party that Churchill had dumped. There were Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood&#x2014;representatives of the Labour Party against which he had directed some of his most hysterical invective. There was the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges, taking notes.</p><p>The question before the meeting was very simple, and one they had been chewing over for the last few days, as the news got blacker and blacker. No one exactly spelled it out, but everyone could see what it was. Should Britain fight? Was it reasonable for young British troops to die in a war that showed every sign of being lost? Or should the British do some kind of deal that might well save hundreds of thousands of lives?</p><p>And if a deal had been done then, and the war had effectively ended with the British exit, might it have been a deal to save the lives of millions around the world?</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think many people of my generation&#x2014;let alone my children&#x2019;s generation&#x2014;are fully conscious of how close we came to it; how Britain could have discreetly, and rationally, called it quits in 1940. There were serious and influential voices who wanted to begin &#x2018;negotiations&#x2019;.</p><p>It is not hard to see why they thought as they did. The news from France was not just bad: it was unbelievably bad, and there did not seem the slightest hope that it would improve. German forces were lunging towards Paris, buffeting aside the French defences with such contemptuous ease that it really looked as if they belonged to some new military master race, pumped with superior zeal and efficiency. Hitler&#x2019;s panzers had surged not just through the Low Countries but through the supposedly impenetrable ravines of the Ardennes; the ludicrous Maginot Line had been bypassed.</p><p>The French generals cut pathetic figures&#x2014;white-haired dodderers in their Clouseau-like kepis. Every time they fell back to some new line of defence, they found that the Germans were somehow already there; and then the Stuka dive-bombers would come down like banshees and the tanks would drive on again.</p><p>The British Expeditionary Force had been cut off in a pocket around the Channel ports. They had tried briefly to counter-attack; they had been repulsed, and now they were waiting to be evacuated at Dunkirk. If Hitler had listened to his generals, he could have smashed us then: sent the ace general Guderian and his tanks into the shrinking and virtually defenceless patch of ground. He could have killed or captured the bulk of Britain&#x2019;s fighting forces, and deprived this country of the physical ability to resist.</p><p>As it was, his Luftwaffe was strafing the beaches; British troops were floating in the water face down; they were firing their Lee Enfields hopelessly at the sky; they were being chopped to bits by the dive-bombers. At that moment, on 28 May, it seemed very possible&#x2014;to generals and politicians, if not to the wider public&#x2014;that the bulk of the troops could be lost.</p><p>The War Cabinet was staring at the biggest humiliation for British armed forces since the loss of the American colonies, and there seemed no way back. It chills the marrow to look at the map of Europe as it must have appeared to that War Cabinet.</p><p>Austria had been engulfed two years earlier; Czechoslovakia was no more; Poland had been crushed; and in the last few weeks Hitler had added a shudder-making list to his portfolio of conquest. He had taken Norway&#x2014;effortlessly outwitting the British, Churchill included, who had spent months elaborating a doomed plan to pre-empt him. He had captured Denmark in little more than four hours.</p><p>Holland had surrendered; the Belgian King had pusillanimously run up the white flag at midnight the previous evening; and with every hour that went by more French forces surrendered&#x2014;sometimes after resistance of insane bravery; sometimes with a despairing and fatalistic ease.</p><p>The most important geostrategic consideration of May 1940 was that Britain&#x2014;the British Empire&#x2014;was alone. There was no realistic prospect of help, or certainly no imminent prospect. The Italians were against us. The fascist leader Mussolini had entered into a &#x2018;Pact of Steel&#x2019; with Hitler, and&#x2014;when it looked as though Hitler couldn&#x2019;t lose&#x2014;would shortly join the war on his side.</p><p>The Russians had signed the nauseating Molotov&#x2013;Ribbentrop pact, by which they had agreed to carve up Poland with the Nazis. The Americans were allergic to any more European wars, understandably: they had lost more than 56,000 men in the First World War, and more than 100,000 if you include the toll from influenza. They were offering not...</p></p><h2>Jazz (English and French Edition)</h2><p>A collection of colorful paper cutouts by the distinguished French artist, Henri Matisse, is accompanied by his observations on life and art</p><p>With this book you hold an artist&#39;s spirit in your hands.

A writer and academic, Tracy carefully constructed a life she loved in her hometown of Boston. But everything is upended when she falls head over heels for the most unlikely mate: a Japanese salary-man based in Osaka, who barely speaks her language. <br><br> Deciding to give fate a chance, Tracy builds a life and marriage in Japan, a country both fascinating and profoundly alienating, where she can read neither the language nor the simplest social cues. There, she finds herself dependent on her husband to order her food, answer the phone, and give her money. When she begins to learn Japanese, she discovers the language is inextricably connected with nuanced cultural dynamics that would take a lifetime to absorb. Finally, when Tracy longs for a child, she ends up trying to grow her family with a Petri dish and an army of doctors with whom she can barely communicate. <br><br> And yet, despite the challenges, Tracy is sustained by her husband&#x2019;s quiet love, and being with him feels more like &#x201c;home&#x201d; than anything ever has. Steadily and surely, she fills her life in Japan with meaningful connections, a loving marriage, and wonder at her adopted country, a place that will never feel natural or easy, but which provides endless opportunities for growth, insight, and sometimes humor. A memoir of travel and romance, <i>The Good Shufu</i> is a celebration of the life least expected: messy, overwhelming, and deeply enriching in its complications.</p><p><b>Tracy Slater</b> is the founder of Four Stories, a global literary series in Boston, Osaka, and Tokyo, for which she was awarded the PEN New England&#x2019;s Friend to Writers Award in 2008.

Three weeks later, he told me he loved me. At least I thought that&#x2019;s what he said.<br><br> We were hidden away far past midnight in my dorm room at a corporate training center. He was balanced above me on his arms while I stared up from below. I was a new faculty member in an East Asia executive MBA program. All twenty of my students were men. He was one of them. I&#x2019;d already fallen in love with him, too.<br><br> I was supposed to be teaching these men business communication: how to lead teams and run meetings in a language and culture not their own. I knew almost nothing about English as a second language&#x2014;or ESL&#x2014;and had been hired under the flawed assumption that since I taught writing to American graduate students in Boston I could coach this group of Asian businessmen to talk like native English speakers.<br><br> I began to realize what I was up against on my first day of class, when I learned that most of my students had never worked with a woman who didn&#x2019;t serve them tea. Anyway, by now, a few weeks into the job, I was already failing miserably in the classroom, never mind my extracurricular late-night transgressions with a student who could barely speak English but had already begun to make my heart spin.<br><br>***<br><br> Back in Boston a month and a half earlier, on the day I&#x2019;d been recruited for the job, I&#x2019;d been warned I might confront challenges as a young American woman teaching senior Asian businessmen. It was early April, before I&#x2019;d ever set foot in the Far East, and the Korean faculty director of the program had tried, indirectly, to prepare me. I had yet to learn that in East Asia the most important communication is almost always indirect, where meaning is often a destination arrived at through multiple circuitous way-stops.<br><br> The director was sitting behind the broad desk in his office, books piled high against the wall, when he introduced his pitch to me. The window behind him boasted a panoramic view of the Charles River, Cambridge stretched out beyond. One of MIT&#x2019;s domes stood proud and gray in the distance, as if nodding sagely at its lesser colleagues across the water.<br><br> &#x201c;The executive students all work for global Japanese and Korean corporations,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be traveling with them to Kobe, Beijing, and Seoul for each of the program&#x2019;s monthlong summer modules, where they&#x2019;ll see firsthand the manufacturing sectors across a range of markets. Then they all come here for nine months.&#x201d; He drew his hands wide in an expansive sweep, as if displaying the whole group in miniature right there. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll finish their degrees in Boston before returning next spring to their homes and companies in Asia.&#x201d; He smiled broadly, then sat back and folded his hands.<br><br> &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be giving them grades. Just sit with them at meals, get them talking, go to their marketing and strategy classes with them. Help them on their case studies and assignments. Some may be demanding, but you can handle this, yes?&#x201d; He leaned forward toward me, both hands on his desk. &#x201c;You have a Ph.D., so you&#x2019;re a professional, no?&#x201d; Sitting back, he laughed then, at what I wasn&#x2019;t sure, but I laughed along with him. I wanted to suggest that&#x2014;for the business-class tickets and a summer semester of highly compensated travel as a kind of &#x201c;conversation coach&#x201d;&#x2014;this was work I could easily manage.<br><br> In truth, not only had I never been to East Asia or taught ESL, my Ph.D. was in English and American literature, not linguistics or organizational behavior. Moreover, I barely had an interest in cultures other than my own, although within my liberal academic circle, my provincialism wasn&#x2019;t something I&#x2019;d easily admit.<br><br> That April morning, just hours before the director offered me the job, I&#x2019;d woken in my street-level studio apartment in Boston&#x2019;s South End, the city where I&#x2019;d always lived and planned to settle for good. As the sun streamed through my old floor-to-ceiling windows, I lay in my high-thread-count sheets and savored both the stillness and predictability of my life as a left-leaning, thirty-six-year-old confirmed Bostonian: overeducated, fiercely protective of my independence, and deeply committed to the cultural values of the liberal northeastern U.S.<br><br> Around me in the silence, the light swept across my bookshelves, full of volumes leaning left and right. Somewhere in the middle of all the Shakespeare and Milton, the Hemingway, Mailer, and Morrison, and the barely skimmed pages of literary theory, stood my own thinly bound doctoral dissertation on gender and violence in the modern American novel. On the floor lay a half-read copy of Vogue. My laptop was perched on a makeshift desk in front of kitchenette shelves stuffed not with dishes or pans but with papers and syllabi from ten years of teaching at local universities, which were crammed next to shopping bags and old tax returns. In the storage loft above the mini kitchen were all the shoes I couldn&#x2019;t fit in the studio&#x2019;s small closet, rows of heels and boots and little ballet-slipper flats stacked on wooden racks.<br><br> As I did most days, I lingered awhile before leaving for my meeting on campus, luxuriating in the quiet, grateful for both the life I&#x2019;d built around me and what it lacked: no complicated marriage or crying child to colonize my time. Then I climbed out of bed, showered, dressed, added a swipe of makeup, and stopped at my usual caf� for a soy chai before heading to the Boston-area university where I now taught. On my way out for the day, I ignored the mezuzah my mother had insisted I hang on the door frame, its tiny Old Testament scroll hidden in silver casing.<br><br> The only time my regular morning ritual differed, before my trip to East Asia changed everything, was the one day a week I&#x2019;d go to Norfolk Corrections Center, a men&#x2019;s medium-security prison. Then I&#x2019;d wake at dawn, skip the makeup, wear an old pair of flats, and drive the barren highway west. I&#x2019;d reach the barbed-wired complex early, then pass through a series of electric gates before arriving at the classroom where I&#x2019;d spend three hours teaching literature and gender studies in a college-behind-bars program to male convicts. This was the work I truly valued, one in a string of progressive education jobs I&#x2019;d had: running writing classes for homeless adults, preparing inner-city teens for college, teaching first-generation undergraduates at a public university. The writing seminars for American MBAs funded my work in these other programs.<br><br> Either way, whether I was headed to prison or the ivory tower, I always began my morning firmly rooted on the exact path I had scripted for myself, what one ex-boyfriend termed &#x201c;your life as a nonpracticing communist.&#x201d; I had a large circle of like-minded friends; a combination of academic jobs that satisfied me politically, socially, and intellectually; plus cash to buy great shoes. I&#x2019;d planned each aspect of my world meticulously until together they created a kind of bulwark against the handful of mistakes I swore I&#x2019;d never make: to take blind leaps of faith, give up my home in Boston, become dependent on a man, build a traditional nuclear family like my parents had, or, most important cook dinner on a regular basis.<br><br> When he sought me out, the Korean director knew me only from my reputation around the business school. The year before, the deans had hired me to create a new writing curriculum for their on-campus graduate management program, and though I told him I&#x2019;d never even been to East Asia, let alone taught there, the director had convinced himself that I was the woman to turn his foreign execs-in-training into English conversationalists&#x2014;and to start in just a few weeks&#x2019; time. Once he floated the idea by me, I assured him (remembering my Spanish- and Vietnamese-speaking students in lockup), &#x201c;Well, I have had nonnative speakers in my literature classes before, lots of times.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Excellent.&#x201d; He nodded, confirming my perfection for the job.<br><br> I played along. After all, I reasoned, the money they were offering for three months of work was more than five times what I&#x2019;d make in a whole year teaching in prison, and I liked to travel. Besides, what could these East Asian executives possibly throw at me that I hadn&#x2019;t already seen either behind bars or in an MBA classroom?</p><h2>Senseless</h2><p><b>Every Serial Killer Knows. . .</b><br><br> The vicious burns scarring the victims' flesh reveal the agony of their last moments.

The enduring fascination of his works arises from his singular fusion of musical innovation and theatrical daring, but also from his largely overlooked engagement with the boldest investigations of modern philosophy.<br><br>Now, in this radically clarifying book, Bryan Magee traces the Wagner's involvement in the intellectual quests of his age, from his youthful embrace of revolutionary socialism, to a Schopenhauerian rejection of the world as illusion, to the near-Buddhist resignation of his final years. Mapping the influence of ideas on Wagner's art, Magee shows how abstract thought can permeate musical work and stimulate creations of great power and beauty. And he unflinchingly confronts the Wagner whose paranoia, egocentricity, and anti-Semitism are as repugnant as his achievements are glorious.<br><br>At once a biography of the composer, an overview of his times, an account of 19th century opera, and an insight into the intellectual and technical aspects of music, Magee's lucid study offers the best explanation of W. H. Auden's judgment that Wagner, for all his notorious difficulties, was "perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived.<br></p><p>Bryan Magee has had a distinguished career as a university professor, music and theater critic, member of Parliament, and author. He is well known for two popular BBC television series on philosophy. Among his internationally acclaimed books are <i>The Story of Philosophy</i>, <i>The Philosophy of Schopenhauer, </i>and <i>Aspects of Wagner</i>.<br>Magee, a British writer on philosophy, music, and theater criticism and a former member of Parliament, has made a remarkable contribution to the already extensive literature on the life and works of Wagner. His central thesis that Wagner's intense study of philosophy had a profound influence on his compositions is lucidly presented in 17 chapters, each rich with historical detail and intellectual discourse. The chapters proceed in rough chronological sequence; we first read of the young Wagner as a left-wing revolutionary and end with his mature, complex relationship with Nietzsche. In the central part of the book, Magee provides an overview of Schopenhauer's philosophy and reveals the extent to which Wagner completely overhauled his own values in order to embrace that thinker's world view. Readers to whom all this may appear somewhat arcane and daunting will be pleasantly surprised by the eminently readable nature of the book. Magee's text is not only illuminating but also highly personal and enormously engaging. The lengthy appendix, in which he tackles head-on the thorny issue of Wagner's anti-Semitism, is a brilliant, balanced discussion and is alone worth the price of the book. Throughout, Magee cites myriad secondary sources but includes no bibliography. Despite this omission, this work is highly recommended for all public and academic libraries. Those readers already passionate about Wagner's works will find new reasons to appreciate them, and those who have avoided his music will find the book a revelation and may be inspired to rethink their phobia.

So when he takes out the drug-dealing thug who killed his girlfriend, the ex-PI gets to cool his heels for 11 years in Attica. It's there that he meets "Little Skag" Farino, the son of an aging Buffalo, New York, mob boss. In exchange for protecting the kid's manhood against any unwanted jailhouse affection, Kurtz gets an audience with Little Skag's father upon his release from prison. <br><br>Semi-retired Don Byron Farino is still clinging to what dwindling power he holds on the New York organized crime scene. He enlists Kurtz's help to track down the Family's missing accountant--a man with too much knowledge of Family business to have on the loose. But someone doesn't want the accountant found. As the story twists and turns and the body count rises, Kurtz no longer knows whom he can trust. Everyone seems to be after something, from the mob boss's sultry yet dangerous daughter, to a hit man named The Dane, an albino killer who is good with a knife, and a dwarf who is armed to the teeth and hell-bent on revenge. <br><br>Bestselling author Dan Simmons expertly builds the tension as he springs one surprise after another, all the while daring the reader to take a ride with Kurtz through the cold, windy streets of Buffalo where one wrong move could mean a belly-full of lead. <br></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, July 2001:</b> Dan Simmons is not an author who writes the same book twice. He doesn't even come close. Since switching from fantasy/horror to mystery, Simmons has written <i>Crook Factory</i>, set in Cuba and starring Ernest Hemingway, and <i>Darwin's Blade</i>, featuring a genius insurance claims investigator who only has to look at a demolished vehicle to be able to know exactly what led up to the crash.<p> With <i>Hardcase</i>, Simmons both pays homage to over-the-top pulp fiction and writes a remarkably good example of it. Joe Kurtz has no intention of giving up his chosen profession of private investigator, even though he's just spent 12 years in jail. He believes it's only a matter of finding the right case. But that case will never come to him, so he pays a call on Byron Tatick Farino, mob boss, and suggests that for $400 a day plus expenses, he'll try to find the Family's missing accountant and also figure out who's hijacking the Family's trucks. Farino is inclined to let him do this since he has nothing to lose, and Joe did save his son from a fate worse than death in Cell Block D.</p><p> So Joe is off and running, and after picking up his ex-assistant, Arlene, he opens an office in the basement of a porn store and begins looking into the Mob's business. He no sooner interviews the accountant's wife than she is found dead and horribly mutilated. </p><p> The list of those who want Joe to butt out is long, and they are evidently very serious about preventing Joe from finding out too much. There's the person who is hijacking the trucks, and wants to continue. There's also a couple of sociopaths (if not psychopaths) named Malcolm and Cutter who work for the Mob's lawyer. Unsurprisingly, they are not exactly loyal and know that there's a $10,000 reward for the guy who wasted Ali, one of the Death Mosque brothers in Cell Block D. Finally, there are the Levine brothers, Manny and Sammy. Joe hasn't heard of either of them, but word is that Manny blames Joe for Sammy's death. </p><p> These numerous and varied storylines remain remarkably lucid as Simmons treats us to a fast-paced thriller with excitement on every page. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Dan Simmons is the author of the critically acclaimed thrillers <i>The Crook Factory</i> and the bestselling <i>Darwin's Blade</i> as well as the award-winning books <i>Hyperion, Carrion Comfort, Song of Kali</i>, and several other highly respected works.

His experiences in the war forced him to question all his assumptions about his country, the nation's leaders and his own sanity.<br>John Laurence covered Vietnam for CBS News from 1965 to 1970. He was judged by his colleagues to be the best television reporter of the war. He and his camera team lived with a squad of U.S. troops in the jungles of War Zone C to film The World of Charlie Company, a documentary that received every major award for broadcast journalism. Despite the professional acclaim, the traumatic stories Laurence covered became a personal burden that he carried long after the war was over. He struggled with memories of the Tet Offensive and the Battle of Hue, incoming artillery at Khe Sanh and Con Thien, the wounding of those around him, the deaths of his friends, the killing of civilians, a colonel who smoked opium during the siege of his camp, American troops who fell in love with their dead comrades. Mostly, his conscience haunted him about a close encounter with a North Vietnamese soldier that forced him to make a decision of life and death.<br>After years of reckoning with his memories, Laurence has made sense of them in this memoir by weaving them into a compelling story. It is laced with humor, anger, love, and the unforgettable tale of a very idiosyncratic cat who was determined to play his part in the Vietnam revolution. In reconstructing his experiences, he has relied not only on his notes and memory, but also on hundreds of hours of film footage shot at the time. This gives the book an uncanny vividness and fidelity to facts.</p><p>With over half a decade of service as a war correspondent in Vietnam, John Laurence earned deserved accolades for his reportage, especially for his documentary <i>The World of Charlie Company.</i> In this superb book, <i>The Cat from Hue</i>, he returns to that time, drawing on long-buried memories to capture the confusion, deceit, and terror of the era.<p> In 1968, John Laurence unhappily found himself dodging bullets and poking among ruins of the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, eventually wandering square into the sights of a gun held by a North Vietnamese soldier, who could easily have shot him dead but did not. It was not his first encounter with mortal danger, and not his last; as this long, intricately constructed memoir unfolds, death greets the reader on nearly every page, along with the more mundane facts of war--the language of soldiers, the things they carried, the numbed resignation to battle as "an edge against fear." (Superstition plays a role, too: Laurence figured that the "coins, charms, four-leaf clovers, religious medals and all kinds of talismans" that he kept with him would somehow shield him from bullets, as perhaps they did.) In the company of a shell-shocked kitten, the cat of his book's title, Laurence goes on to document the lives and deaths of young soldiers during the invasion of Cambodia, men who, though personally decent in the main, were part of "a monster that inflicted so much random violence and death it produced an entire new body of evil, a catalogue of cruelty that overshadowed any possible virtue that might have come from defeating the Communists."</p><p> Harrowing, sometimes hallucinatory, written from among the weeds and rubble, and one of the best in a crowded field, Laurence's book deserves the widest possible audience. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>John Laurence was a foreign correspondent for CBS and ABC News who covered many of the most important events of our times: from the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 to the bringing down of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet empire. He reported more than fifteen wars and revolutions. He lives in rural England with a tribe of abandoned cats.</p><h2>The Twins Platoon: An Epic Story of Young Marines at War in Vietnam</h2><p>In the evening of June 28, 1967, 150 young Americans were sworn into the Marine Corps as part of the pre-game ceremonies of a Minnesota Twins baseball game. Before the end of the fourth inning these volunteers were being hustled on to buses, on their way to boot camp. It was a journey that would take them from a boyhood of baseball in the American heartland to manhood on the killing fields of Vietnam. Christy Sauro was one of the Twins Platoon, and in this book he tells what it was like-from the pomp and ceremony of induction to the all-too-real initiation by fire that would shortly follow: in mere months, he and most of the Twins Platoon were on the ground in Vietnam and promptly faced with some of the toughest fighting of the war, the Siege of Khe Sanh and the Tet Offensive, including the brutal Battle for Hue. From baseball to boot camp to brutal combat, his is a firsthand story of American life being lived at the limits-and changed forever.</p><p>Former Marine Corps Sergeant Christy W. Sauro Jr. was a member of the Twins Platoon. After he returned from Vietnam, Sauro had a successful career in the insurance business. His writing has been published in magazines such as Leatherneck and Reader&#x2019;s Digest. He lives near Minneapolis with his wife and children. The Twin&#x2019;s Platoon is his first book.www.twinsplatoon.com<p><strong><em>Leatherneck Magazine</em>, September 2006 </strong></p><p>&#x201c;The stories [in the <em>Twins Platoon</em>] are told in the words of those Sauro interviewed. Often, the simplicity by which total horrors of the war are described is the most chilling aspect of what we read. Equally cold are the stories of confrontations between the Marines and demonstrating civilians protesting the war. There are few good endings to the stories, but Sauro stays true to the truth, and the result is a book well worth reading...<em>The Twins Platoon</em> is a remarkable achievement, and Christy W. Sauro Jr. is to be commended for the single-mindedness and determination that enabled him to write it.&#x201d;</p><p> </p><br><br><p><b><i>Military Book Club,</i></b><b> March 2006 </b></p><p>"Christy Sauro was a member of the platoon and his battle accounts are incredible. His jarring memoir takes you to some of the craziest fighting in the war where Marines inflicted serious damage on the enemy. But Sauro doesn't shy away from the beating his side took, as well. The tales of Marines falling to the bullets and artillery of the enemy are truly heartbreaking."</p><p> </p><br><br><strong><em>Military Heritage,</em> August 2006 </strong>&#x201c;Every person who has ever been in the military, especially in a combat situation, often wonders what happened to those they served with. Chisty Sauro, in his new book The Twins Platoon, wondered just about that but decided to do something about it. Sauro&#x2019;s story is an interesting one. After years of exhaustive research, he compiled dozens of taped interviews, questionnaires, and scoured the official records to write an account of what became of individuals who went off to war from his home state of Minnesota...The author does a masterful job of weaving together all the various accounts. Often times it is poignant. From the DMZ to Da Nanag, they served with pride and honor. Sauro and his fellow Marines embody the spirit of the Marine Corps, giving meaning to their motto Semper Fidelis.&#x201d;<em><strong> </strong></em><strong><em>Military Trader Magazine,</em> November 2006</strong>&#x201c;...powerful, engaging and respectful. In recounting the volunteer experience, Sauro has hit a home run with The Twins Platoon.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Stolen Prince: Gannibal, Adopted Son of Peter the Great, Great-Grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, and Europe&#39;s First Black Intellectual</h2><p><p>In the spring of 1703, a young African boy stepped off a slave ship in Constantinople, the gateway between East and West. Huddling in chains, with other frightened captives, the seven-year-old claimed to be a prince of Abyssinia, a "noble Moor" kidnapped and stolen out of Africa. His tragedy was shared by millions of black people caught up in the Islamic slave trade, but his destiny was unique: rescued by Peter the Great, the young African became Abram Petrovich Gannibal.</p><p>Russia's westernizing tsar adopted the child and, in a bizarre nature-and-nurture experiment, lavished on him the best education available in the new "European" capital of Saint Petersburg. Gannibal, the "Negro of Peter the Great," soared to dizzying heights as a soldier, diplomat, mathematician and spy. He was f�ted in glittering salons, from the Winter Palace to the Louvre, and came to know Voltaire and Montesquieu, who praised him as the "dark star of Russia's enlightenment." At the same time, his military exploits, from northern Spain to the icy wastes of Siberia -- to say nothing of his marital problems -- sealed Gannibal's reputation as the Russian Othello.</p><p>African prince or not, the ex-slave founded a dynasty of his own in Russia, where he came to embody the strengths and weaknesses of the country itself -- volatile, courageous, handsome, gifted and always astonishing. His descendants included not only Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet, but also, in England, several Mountbattens and others close to the royal family.</p></p><p><p>Hugh Barnes, a journalist and Russian specialist educated at Cambridge and Oxford, covered the wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan for newspapers in the UK and abroad.</p>In this disappointing biography, Russian scholar and journalist Barnes claims to seek the truth behind the story of Alexander Pushkin's black great-grandfather, Abram Petrovich Gannibal (1696&#x2013;1781), who was born a slave, raised as a Russian prince and employed by Peter the Great as a military engineer, diplomat and spy. Pushkin's account of his elusive ancestor mutated into an unfinished novel, <i>The Negro of Peter the Great</i>. Traveling to the Logone Delta in Chad, Barnes impressively sleuths Gannibal's likely origins. He entertains with his description of 18th-century Constantinople, where the boy Gannibal was taken as a slave to work as a page in the sultan's harem. But the author becomes pedantic when weighing the evidence for Gannibal's removal by Russian ambassadors, supplying far too much information on Russian foreign emissaries and court politics. Indeed, throughout the biography we periodically lose sight of Gannibal altogether. Despite meticulously tracing his subject's career (even visiting a ruin of one of Gannibal's fortifications), evoking the racism of the Enlightenment and detailing the strife of Gannibal's first, singularly unsuccessful marriage, this biography lacks a historical purpose or thesis, hovering tentatively around a cluster of facts. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>(June 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's a hard and dangerous pilgrimage to the West, fighting the elements as well as the unfriendly fauna. Then there's the backbreaking work of prospecting combined with dealing with the numerous and equally frustrated prospectors. Discouraged, Jasper packs up and returns to his family and it's, "Back to farmhouse,/ Chickens, cow,/Barnyard, fences,/Pitchfork, plow." While children will enjoy the rhythm of this laconic tale, supplemental narrative may be necessary to fill in the period details and define mining terminology such as "sluicing," "vein," and "claim," not to mention the arcane "long tom" (a gold-washing trough). Nonetheless, Kay's personalized approach to history is a hoot. Schindler's colored-pencil drawings on brown, flecked paper are detailed, visually fleshing out the mining process and are often humorous, showing bumper-to-bumper covered wagons heading to California, circling vultures on the hot trail, erect grizzlies scaring miners way up into trees, and, finally, Jasper gratefully kissing his cow upon his humble return to the farm. This is a terrific read-aloud that painlessly introduces children to the unique American folly that played a significant role in expansionism.<br><i>John Sigwald, Unger Memorial Library, Plainview, TX</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kay debuts with a rollicking tale about an idealistic farmer's quest for gold and glory during the gold rush of 1849. Jasper's dreams of discovering gold lead him on a journey westward, leaving farm and family behind. However, Jasper is dismayed at the hardships he encounters while searching for the elusive metal. Albeit brief, Kay's minimalist verses, set in sing-song rhymes, convey their message with piercing clarity. ``Icy water,/Wet feet, cold./Sluicing, panning,/`Where's the gold?'/Grumpy miners,/Nuggetssmall/Jasper scowling,/Fireside brawl.'' Increasingly disgruntled and disillusioned, Jasper has a close encounter with a rattlesnake that prompts his return home. Back in the cozy comfort of his farm, the resilient Jasper benignly waves on other aspiring miners, wishing them well. Kay realistically depicts the wild expectations that caused so many to abandon their way of life to gamble on a long shot and the often harsh conditions they encountered in California. Schindler's detailed illustrations, executed in colored pencil, provide readers with a glimpse into a forty-niner's world. As an introduction to a vital piece of American history, it's wryly humorous and unflinchingly candid. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Carril coached the perennial Ivy League powerhouse for 29 seasons before his 1996 retirement, and his hardwood hard line couldn't have been simpler: play smart. Of course, it helped that his players were smart enough--they <i>did</i> get into Princeton--to compensate for any lack of size and talent. Carril preached winning through intelligence, selfless play, and dogged defense. <i>The Smart Take from the Strong</i> is his bible. While it makes a pass here and there at biography, the book's beauty is the keenness of its Carrilion collection of on- and off-the-court parables and beatitudes. How can you turn a deaf ear to eternal verities such as "Bad shooters are always open" and "The ability to rebound is in inverse proportion to the distance your house is from the nearest railroad tracks"? And how can you not love a coach who can suggest, when pondering why the university kept rehiring him, "I think they kept me because some of my players seemed to be better people for the experience," and <i>not</i> have it sound like a crow?"Pete Carril is the Stonewall Jackson of ncaa basketball&#x2014;unbelievable in victory, unforgettable in defeat."&#x2014;John McPhee. "Pete Carril is very clear about what he wants in basketball, and he wills things to happen."&#x2014;Senator Bill Bradley. "Warm and wise . . . disarmingly candid."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly. <p>"The strong take from the weak, but the smart take from the strong." So said Pete Carril&#x2019;s father, a Spanish immigrant who worked for thirty-nine years in a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, steel mill. His son stood only five-foot-six but nonetheless became an All-State basketball player in high school, a Little All-American in college, and a highly successful coach. After twenty-nine years as Princeton University&#x2019;s basketball coach, he became an assistant coach with the nba&#x2019;s Sacramento Kings. In 1997 he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. </p><p>Coach Carril inspired his teams with his own strength of character and drive to win, and he demonstrated time and again how a smart and dedicated team could compete successfully against bigger programs and faster, stronger, more athletic players. His teams won thirteen conference championships, made eleven NCAA Tournament appearances, and led the nation in defense fourteen times. </p><p>Throughout his reflections on a lifetime spent on the basketball court and the bench, Carril demonstrates deep respect for the contest, his empathy and engagement with the players, humility with his own achievements, a pragmatic vision of discipline and fundamentals, and an enduring joy in the game. </p><p>This is an inspiring and wonderful book, even for those who never made a basket. </p><p>Dan White is an award-winning freelance writer, the author of eight books, and a contributor to the New York Times, Philadelphia Inquirer, and Detroit Free Press.

In <i>Benedict's Dharma</i>, Zen priest Norman Fisher, meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein, professor Judith Simmer-Brown, and Yifa, a nun of the Chinese Buddhist tradition, flesh out <i>The Rule of Saint Benedict</i>, which has guided the organization and daily life of the Western Christian monastic tradition since the ninth century. Time after time, these Buddhists find in <i>The Rule of Saint Benedict</i>, which is included in its entirety, points that resonate with the their own experiences--points such as an emphasis on reverence, a pragmatic mindset, and the need for hard work and practice. From these agreements, as well as out of some marked differences, come lively evaluations of both Buddhist and Christian practices. And in the end, as the Christian monk David Steindl-Rast says in his "Afterword," the resources of the monastic tradition, for lay people as much as for monks, still have much to offer everyday life. Taking a Christian text as a source of inspiration for Buddhism offers a new rapprochement for those who have fled to Buddhism from a Christian upbringing. And for the Christian faithful, it offers a fresh perspective on a revered but musty classic. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Patrick Henry is executive director of the Institute of Ecumenical and Cultural Research at St. John's Abbey &amp; University, Minnesota.

He will travel the length of the land, have adventures, and, through fate or tragedy, fall in love with the one woman he must not have. Uther is a compelling love story and, like the other books in the Camulod Chronicles, a version of the legend that is more realistic than anything that has been available to readers before.<br></p><p>The seventh book in Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles, <i>Uther</i> is a parallel novel to <i>The Eagle's Brood</i>. It fills in some gaps about another major character in the Arthurian legend, Uther Pendragon, who is Merlyn's cousin and King Arthur's father.<p> <i>Uther</i> tells the tale of a young man torn between his love for his adopted Camulod and for the land of his birth, Cambria. Born to be one of the seven Chiefs of the Pendragon federation of Cambria, with the possibility of becoming its king one day, Uther goes from being a carefree boy to a seasoned leader of his people who must wage war to protect his land. Along the way, Uther loses his friendship with Merlyn and falls in love with the wife of his enemy, thereby forging a union that will lead to the birth of Arthur, King of the Britons.</p><p> Once again Whyte weaves a tale of intrigue, betrayal, love, and war in a gritty and realistic tale that continues to explore the legend of Camelot. With <i>Uther</i>, Whyte is at his best--he takes his time telling the story and allows his main characters to be both flawed and heroic. Fans of the Camulod Chronicles will be familiar with the inevitable ending of this book, but <i>Uther</i> is a worthwhile addition to the series. For those new to the series, <i>Uther</i> can stand alone as an entry to the story, but it might be best to start with <i>The Skystone</i>, where Whyte's tale truly begins. <i>--Kathie Huddleston</i></p><p>"A series that promises to provide historic plausibility to the legend of King Arthur...the best of its type in the near quarter of a century since Mary Stewart's version of these legends burst upon the publishing scene."&#x2015;<i>The Chattanooga Times</i></p><p>With <i>Uther</i>, Jack Whyte, author of the richly praised Camulod Chronicles, has given us a portrait of Uther Pendragon, Merlyn's shadow--his boyhood companion and closest friend.

The hero of <i>Troubles, </i>having survived the battles of World War I, makes his way to Ireland in 1919, in search of his once-wealthy fianc�e. What he finds is her family's enormous seaside hotel in a spectacular state of decline, overgrown and overrun by herds of cats and pigs and the few remaining guests. From this strange perch, moving from room to room as the hotel falls down around him, he witnesses the distant tottering of the Empire in the East and the rise of the violent "Troubles" in Ireland.</p><p>J. G. FARRELL (1935-1979) was an Anglo-Irish novelist who grew up in England and Ireland. At the age of forty-four he was hit by a wave while fishing on the Irish coast and was washed out to sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> JOHN SUTHERLAND is the author of seventeen books on literature and language, a regular columnist for <i>The Guardian, </i>and an emeritus professor at University College, London.<br>&nbsp;<br> Introduction by John Sutherland<b>From the Introduction<br><br></b>Late in his career, in conversation with his friend Paul Barker, Farrell confided that &#x2018;the really interesting thing that&#x2019;s happened during my lifetime has been the decline of the British Empire&#x2019;. The choice of epithet is tellingly unfeeling. He did not lament or rejoice in that decline. Why not? Because when things break down you see more clearly how they work. That &#x2018;interested&#x2019; him. Unlike most other imperial powers, Britain had given up its colonial possessions without too much bloody struggle and, to be honest, something resembling relief. But for every empire in its terminal phase there is always one colonial possession which cannot, under any circumstances, be let go of. In France, as Farrell had witnessed in the 1960s, it was <i>Alg�rie Fran�aise</i> &#x2013; that chunk of North Africa bizarrely designated an outlying region of &#x2018;metropolitan France&#x2019;. In England it was &#x2018;John Bull&#x2019;s Other Island&#x2019;. Albion could no more part with the six counties than it could carve off Cornwall and give it to Jersey.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the 1960s ended Farrell was mature enough to handle such big themes. He was thirty-five years old, <i>nel mezzo del cammin</i>, in Dante&#x2019;s description. He was impatient to do something worthy of his new sense of what his fiction should be. &#x2018;When I look in the mirror,&#x2019; he wrote in a notebook, &#x2018;I notice that I&#x2019;m growing old and still haven&#x2019;t done anything good. I remind myself of the main character in Chekhov&#x2019;s masterly &#x2018;&#x2018;A Dull Story&#x2019;&#x2019;.&#x2019; Propelled by amphetamines and a dynamic new agent, he wrote <i>Troubles</i>. Whatever else, it would not be a dull story.<br> &nbsp;<br> Novelists, like generals, need luck. Farrell&#x2019;s chronicle of the aftermath of the 1916 Irish uprising, came out in 1970, a few months after Ulster had exploded once more into flames. Few novels have been more timely. The more so since, as Farrell always insisted, <i>Troubles</i> was as much about the present as the past. The novel was generally applauded for its topicality but caused much perplexity as to its tone. British soldiers and British citizens were dying. Why, it was asked, was Mr Farrell not entirely serious about this surely serious issue. The oddly comic approach &#x2013; a cross between Evelyn Waugh and P. G. Wodehouse as one critic neatly put it &#x2013; is very much an acquired taste. British readers had not yet acquired it and would not fully do so until the Irish flames died down a bit.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Troubles</i> is set in 1919&#x2013;21. The hero of the novel, so to call him, is an English ex-Major (still addressed by that now honorary title) who, if not a military hero, did his duty in the trenches. What the Great War was all about he was never quite sure. Shell-shock has, in the medical description of the time, rendered him &#x2018;neurasthenic&#x2019; &#x2013; chronically passive. Farrell had been impressed, a couple of years before, by reading <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>. Musil&#x2019;s use of his passive hero, Ulrich, as a reflecting surface rather than an agent had struck him as a technique to copy.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the novel opens Major Brendan Archer has come to Kilnalough, on the south-eastern coast of Ireland, to claim his bride. He has not rushed to do so. Months-long medical treatment for a post-war nervous breakdown has been required. Nor is he is entirely sure that he is actually engaged to Angela Spencer. There was a brief encounter, on leave in 1916, in Brighton. Did he propose? Did she accept? He has no distinct memory &#x2013; although her letters to him during his time in the trenches make it clear that she regards him as her <i>fianc�</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Angela, once a <i>belle</i>, now an invalid (dying, although Archer does not know it), lives in a hotel, the Majestic, owned and managed by her father Edward &#x2013; a fanatic Unionist, and &#x2018;ex-India&#x2019;. The Majestic is majestic no longer. The statue of Queen Victoria on horseback at its entrance is stained green (ominous colour) by time and fungus. During the climactic siege by the Sinn Feiners it will be violated by gelignite &#x2013; incompetently, alas, leaving the monarch still mounted but obscenely skirtless. The hotel&#x2019;s fabric is in a condition of advanced decomposition. Its only residents are a crew of genteel old ladies no longer capable of paying their bills but with nowhere else to go. A comic moment of the hotel&#x2019;s inexorable crumble conveys the distinctive tang of Farrell&#x2019;s narrative:<br> &nbsp;<br> One unseasonably warm day the giant m of majestic detached itself from the fa�ade of the building and fell four storeys to demolish a small table at which a very old and very deaf lady, an early arrival for Christmas, had decided to take tea in the mild sunshine that was almost like summer. She had looked away for a moment, she explained to Edward in a very loud voice (almost shouting, in fact), trying to remember where the floral clock had been in the old days. She had maybe closed her eyes for a moment or two. When she turned back to her tea, it had gone! Smashed to pieces by this strange, seagull-shaped piece of cast iron (she luckily had not recognized it or divined where it had come from). [pp. 545&#x2013;6]<br> &nbsp;<br> It would be a dull reader who did not pick up the primary allegory. It glows radioactively. Colonial Ireland itself is in terminal decay. But the allegory is spiced by Farrell&#x2019;s idiosyncratic sense of the absolute absurdity of things &#x2013; even things which the mass of us find rather serious. One can&#x2019;t help feeling sometimes he is laughing at us.<br> &nbsp;<br> After Angela&#x2019;s surprising death, Archer falls in love with a local Catholic woman much smarter than he and disinclined to do more than toy, cat-and-mouse style, with her bumbling English admirer. Spencer, meanwhile, goes certifiably mad. The civil unrest heats up to the point of rebellion. There is the <i>de rigueur</i> siege, but so disintegrated is the Majestic that it collapses and burns down of its own structural weakness leaving, among the ashes, a wilderness of 250 indestructible toilet pans and wash-basins.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Troubles</i> received polite but grudging reviews. A scathing denunciation in the <i>New Statesman</i>, which took deep offence at his <i>pas s�rieux</i> tone, caused Farrell some serious irritation. It was a hard novel to get hold of in the, once again, troubled early 1970s. Could one decently smile at Farrell&#x2019;s Irish comedy with bombs going off in London or some poor child being blown to smithereens on the Falls Road?<br> &nbsp;<br> It took years &#x2013; forty, to be precise &#x2013; before <i>Troubles</i> could be read as it should. In 2010 the Booker committee, convened to nominate the best novel of the Prize&#x2019;s &#x2018;lost year&#x2019;, 1970 gave the award to <i>Troubles</i>. It would have been piquant for Farrell (dead thirty years) to have seen the <i>New Statesman</i> join, belatedly, in the chorus of acclaim, instructing its readers to take <i>Troubles</i> on holiday with them as their beach book.</p><h2>Tunnel in the Sky</h2><p>Rod Walker didn&#39;t know where in the universe he had been sent ... he only knew he somehow had to survive.

Visit his website at www.lifewrite.com.<b>From Chapter One</b> <p>From this far perspective, the planet Bajor was a misty, radiant opal, beautiful as a star, peaceful as the long-lost memories of the womb. Alone in her shuttle pod, Major Kira soared high above the surface of her home world, aching with the irony of that apparent quietude. Once, Bajor might have known only harmony -- but not in Kira's time, nor her parents, nor her grandparents. War had torn the planet apart for far too many bloody years. But the planet of her birth, a gentle haze of oceans even now receeding to a glittering demistar, was still the most beautiful place that Kira could ever dream of. </p><p>The shuttle's engines hummed beneath her. Escape from Bajor's gravity was the only tricky part of the entire journey: she could begin to relax and slip into one of the vexing contemplations that often plagued her at this point. This time, her mind took a particularly troublesome turn: What small shifts in circumstance might have given Bajor a greater chance at peace? </p><p>Bajor was too close to the Cardassian border, a tempting prize, too wealthy by far, whether wealth was measured in material or spiritual values. That last, perhaps, was what had proved her undoing. To have nothing and be unprepared for the predators in the world, was one thing. But to be rich and still unable to defend oneself seemed to motivate not merely greed, but anger. </p><p>Her reflection gleamed faintly in the shuttle's windows. She watched her hands play across the controls. Major Kira was still attractive, and she would be for many years to come. She had dedicated her life to service, a decision it was too late to change, or turn back from. Like too many, she had both the gift and the curse of knowing her place in the world. A gift because it removes uncertainty. A curse because it sometimes eliminates wonder. </p><p>She was not the only one possessing this barbed gift. Another, she knew, understood his place in the world. And although they had experienced difficulties and differences, of all of the people who worked and lived in the place called Deep Space Nine, Benjamin Sisko was perhaps closest to a brother. He knew what it was to find his place in the world. He grasped both the positive and negative aspects of that understanding, the way in which it was both gift and curse. Benjamin Sisko. The man to whom she would have to relay her data, information too precious to be trusted to any transmitted message, no matter how secure. Information which would add to his already passive load of stress. </p><p>The shuttle trip between Bajor and DS9 lasts approximately three hours. Originally, DS9 was a Cardassian mining station built in orbit above the planet Bajor during the Cardassian occupation. Constructed in 2351, initially called Terok Nor, DS9 was intended to exploit Bajor's rich uridium deposits. The Cardassians retained control of the station until 2369, when they relinquished their claim on Bajor and retreated from the region. Now administered by the Federation, the station fell under the jurisdiction of the Bajoran government and was subject to its laws. </p><p>During much of the travel time between Bajor and the station, Major Kira allowed herself to fall into a state very close to a trance. If she could just quiet her mind, this portion of the trip could be quite soothing. There were so many incredible sights, so much for the eyes to feast on -- even more so since the discovery of the wormhole. The Bajoran wormhole was an invisible bridge between worlds, inhabited by creatures which her people referred to as the Prophets. The Prophets, who had supplied spiritual governance to the Bajorans over the years, now linked the Bajor system to the distant Gamma Quadrant. </p><p>This remarkable place, in which ordinary rules of consciousness were sometimes nullified, was the spot to which Deep Space Nine had been towed. As Kira drew nearer the station, she felt herself shifting from one way of being to another, one mode of operation to another. From contemplative wanderer to first officer. </p><p>Home to about three hundred permanent staff DS9's immense docking ring was the most remarkable aspect of the structure. When approached from the side its docking pylons resembled nothing so much as a glittering pair of parentheses linked by central docking ring. With the ease of long practice, she glided her shuttle into the docking port. There was no need for her to rely on one of the upper or lower docking pylons, the large, skeletal-looking arms which extended vertically from the horizontal docking ring. </p><p>The actions that followed she performed on pure autopilot. There was no sense of challenge in this, only an overwhelming concern for the man that she called friend, and the knowledge that she bore not one, but two pieces of evil news. It was more than any man should be forced to bear. It might be...what was the Earth expression? "The straw that broke the camel's back?" </p><p> </p><p>Copyright� 1998 by Steve Barnes</p></p><h2>Simply Great Breads: Sweet and Savory Yeasted Treats from America&#39;s Premier Artisan Baker</h2><p><p>If bread is the staff of life, then this book by renowned artisanal baker Daniel Leader is every home baker's must-have cookbook.

The Terrestria Chronicles allegory series was written with a three-fold purpose: to honor Jesus Christ as King, to challenge young readers to love and serve Him, and to teach them to guard their hearts for Him. The focus of the series is always on the King. This is not Narnia; this is not Lord of the Rings. The Terrestria Chronicles were written to honor Christ and be as true to Scripture as possible. Some readers have compared the Terrestria books to The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, though this series is much more readable, relevant, and action-packed than Bunyan s classic work. Written for ages ten and up, the Terrestria series is ideal for family devotions, classroom use, or individual enjoyment. The Castle of Faith is in an uproar when the priceless Crown of Kuros is stolen in broad daylight from the castle keep. All evidence points to Morphina, a wicked enchantress who can transform herself to appear as any animal or person. Prince Josiah, Prince Selwyn, and the other knights of the castle engage in a quest to find the crown before it falls into the hands of Argamor. But Josiah alone can recover the crown, and to do so he must engage in an impossible battle. This fourth adventure, the very heart of the Terrestria allegory series, will cause the reader to ponder a royal question that no one else can answer</p><p>Evangelist Ed Dunlop Ed Dunlop has worked in children&#39;s ministries full-time for thirty-two years.

His Young Refugee historical series includes Escape to Liechtenstein and The Incredible Rescues. His latest allegory series, the seven title Terrestria Chronicles, is a must-read for any family raising children in today s society. The author grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He was raised in a Christian home and was led to Christ as a young child by his mother. He graduated from Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College in 1975 at the age of nineteen, and has served churches in California, Arizona, and Tennessee as assistant pastor and Christian Education Director. He and his family entered full-time evangelism in March of 1988. Ed and his wife, Janice, have three children, Rebecca, Steve and Phillip, and make their home in north Georgia. Ed enjoys canoeing, motorcycling and SCUBA diving. His sons are also certified divers. Ed currently serves as a volunteer diver at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and enjoys feeding the fish, sharks, stingrays and moray eels as groups of school children watch.The Terrestria Chronicles consists of seven books: - The Sword, The Ring and The Parchment - The Quest for Seven Castles - The Search for Everyman - The Crown of Kuros - The Dragon s Egg - The Golden Lamps - The Great War The series centers around a medieval theme of knights, princesses, castles, etc. Christ is King Emmanuel and the King saves the main character, Josiah, from Argamor (Satan) in the first book. After Josiah is brought into the Kingdom of Terrestria, he is mentored by Sir Faithful and learns what it means to be a son of the King. In each book, Josiah undergoes various trials and learns about faith, the power of his King, and that he cannot rely on his own power to gain success. In the third book, The Search for Everyman, two more main characters are introduced Prince Selwyn and his sister, Princess Gilda. They aid Josiah in his many adventures throughout the rest of the series. One aspect of the books that I really liked was the naming of many of the many peoples and places Sir Wisdom, the Path of Righteousness, the Castle of Faith, Captain Temptation, Woebegone, Discouragement and so on. The series is written for ages 10 and up; some younger readers won&#39;t know the definition of some of these names, but they will get a general understanding of their meanings after reading through these books! The Biblical principles that are taught in this book are sound and I found the allegories in each story helpful in showing me a new way to look at the lessons in the Bible. I don&#39;t want to give any specific examples, but I loved the way that the author takes modern day items and ideas and shows how they are Satan&#39;s tools for trying to draw us away from our Lord. We are encouraged over and over again to make Christ our first priority and shown the value of doing so. My favorite book was The Great War which tells the story of the book of Revelation in terms that a child can understand. It is the final book in the series and depicts the greatness of our King, leaving a lasting impression in my mind. I thought about this book for several days afterwards. I plan to read this series with my son as his Bible study during our upcoming school year. We will go through one book monthly, reading and discussing each story and learning more about our King of kings and Lord of lords! I know that he will be enraptured by the fantasy setting and able to identify with Josiah. I have read a modified children s version of The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress with my children, but I believe that The Terrestria Chronicles are much easier to understand while getting many of the same points across to the reader. They are definitely more action-packed! I highly recommend this series for all families ... it will open up a whole new world of understanding of what it means to be a son or daughter of our wonderful King! - Product Review by Kris Price, Assistant to the Publishers, The Old Schoolhouse Magazine, LLC --The Old Schoolhouse Magazine</p><h2>A Woggle of Witches</h2><p>The witches are frightened by strange creatures on the night of their special celebration</p><p></p><h2>Irving and Muktuk: Two Bad Bears</h2><p>When two devious polar bears make yet another attempt at stealing the muffins and ruining the New Year&#39;s Blueberry Muffin Festival, Yellowtooth&#39;s Officer Bunny must stay on top of the situation in order to put a stop to their plans.

She discovers that a quilt she has stitched for her uncle Jacob with five unusual patterns of his own design contains hidden clues to guide runaway slaves along the Underground Railroad.

The impending departure of two founding members means untold changes for the Elm Creek Quilters.

Will it be Maggie, whose love of history shines through in all her projects; Anna, whose food-themed quilts are wonderfully innovative; Russ, the male quilter with a completely original style; Karen, a novice teacher whose gifts for language complement her deep understanding of the quilters' mission; or Gretchen, the soulful veteran whose craft is inspired by quilting tradition? <br><br>A Roaring Twenties adventure unfolds in <i>The Quilter's Homecoming</i>, as young bride Elizabeth Bergstrom Nelson sets off with her husband, Henry, from her family home of Elm Creek Manor in Pennsylvania.

Expecting to assume ownership of Triumph Ranch, the couple instead learns that their deed is a fake, and that they must work for the rightful proprietors to earn their keep. Resourceful Elizabeth trades her trousseau -- including the fine quilts stitched by her Bergstrom relatives -- for the practical goods the Nelsons need to survive and finds friendship with California native Rosa Diaz Barclay. Yet it is Elizabeth's discovery of a mysterious cache of quilts made by a member of the Diaz family that reveals a misplaced legacy of love, land, and ancestral ties.

Since Homer first sang the wrath of Achilles and the ancient Sumerians set down their tales of Gilgamesh, warriors, soldiers, and fighters have fascinated us; they are a part of every culture, every literary tradition, every genre. <i>All Quiet on the Western Front, From Here to Eternity, </i>and <i>The Red Badge of Courage </i>have become part of our literary canon, taught in classrooms all around the country and the world.

Now that Sweyn actually wore the crown, he had let the En glish king buy his peace with a ship full of silver. Conn took this very ill. <br>&#x201c;England is the greatest prize. You swore this to me.&#x201d; <br>Sweyn pulled furiously at his long forked mustaches. His eyes glittered. &#x201c;I have not forgotten. And the time will come. Meanwhile, there is Hakon the Jarl, up in Norway. I cannot turn my back on him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So you called in the Jomsvikings instead of .ghting him yourself,&#x201d; Conn said. &#x201c;I see being King has made you womanish as well as pursefond.&#x201d; <br>He turned on his heel before Sweyn could speak, and walked off down the boardwalk toward the King&#x2019;s great hall. His cousin Raef, who went everywhere with him, followed at his side. Sweyn bellowed after them, but neither of them paid heed. <br>Conn said, &#x201c;How can I believe anything he says ever again?&#x201d; <br>Raef said, &#x201c;Who would you rather .ght for?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Conn said. &#x201c;But I will .nd out.&#x201d; <br>That night in his great hall at Helsingor, Sweyn had a feasting, and there came many of his own hirdmen, including Conn and Raef, but also the chiefs of the Jomsvikings, Sigvaldi Haraldsson and Bui the Stout. Raef sat down at the low table, since with Conn he was now on the King&#x2019;s sour side. <br>Conn sat beside him, his black curly hair and beard a wild mane around his head. His gaze went continually to the Jomsvikings at the table across the way. Raef knew his curiosity; they had heard much of the great company of the Jomsvikings, of their fortress in the east, and their skill at war, which they gave to whoever would pay them enough. They weren&#x2019;t actually supposed to have chiefs, but to hold all in common as free men, and Raef wondered if Sigvaldi here and the barrel- shaped Bui were messengers more than chiefs. They wore no fancy clothes, such as Sweyn&#x2019;s red coats of silk and fur, and their beards and hair hung shaggy and long. Sigvaldi was a big man, square shouldered, with curling yellow hair that .owed into his beard. <br>Beside him, Conn said, &#x201c;I like their looks. They are hard men, and proud.&#x201d; <br>Raef said nothing, being slower to judgment. Across the way, Sigvaldi had seen Conn watching, indeed, and lifted a cup to him, and Conn drank with him. It was the strong beer, thick as bear piss, and the slaves were carrying around ewers of it to re.ll any cup that went even half- empty. Raef reached out and turned his empty cup upside down. <br>When they were .nished with the meat and settling in to drink, Sweyn stood up and lifted his cup, and called on Thor and Odin and gave honor to them. The men all shouted and drank, but Sweyn was not .nished. <br>&#x201c;In their honor also, it&#x2019;s our Danish custom to offer vows, which are most sacred now&#x2014;&#x201d; He held out his cup to be .lled again. &#x201c;And here in the names of those most high, I swear one day to make myself King of En gland!&#x201d; <br>The men all through the hall gave up a roar of excitement; across the .eld of waving arms and cheering faces, Raef saw Sweyn turn and glare at Conn. &#x201c;Who else offers such a vow as this?&#x201d; <br>The uproar faded a moment, and Sigvaldi lurched to his feet. &#x201c;When the war for En gland comes, let it be, but we are here for the sake of Hakon the Jarl, in Norway, who is an oathbreaker and a turncoat.&#x201d; <br>Voices rose, calling Hakon the Jarl every sort of evil thing, traitor and thief and liar. And the slaves went around and .lled the cups. Steeped in drink, red- faced Sigvaldi held his cup high so that all would look. When the hall was hushed, he shouted, &#x201c;Therefore I vow here before the high gods to lead the Jomsvikings against Hakon, wherever he hides! And I will not give up until he is beaten.&#x201d; <br>There was a great yell from all there, and they drank. The hall was crowded with men now, those sitting at the tables, many of them Jomsvikings, and many others standing behind them who were Sweyn&#x2019;s house carls and crews. <br>&#x201c;A mighty vow,&#x201d; Sweyn called. &#x201c;An honor to the gods Hakon has betrayed. The rest of you&#x2014;will you follow your chief in this?&#x201d; His eyes shot an oblique glance at Conn, down at the lower table. &#x201c;Which of you will join the Jomsvikings?&#x201d; <br>At this, Dane and Jomsviking alike began shouting out oaths and vows against Hakon, while the slaves with the jugs plied their work. <br>Then Conn rose. <br>Raef held his breath, alarmed at this, and around the hall, the other men hushed. <br>Conn held out his cup. <br>&#x201c;I swear I will sail with you, Sigvaldi, and call out Hakon face- to- face, and not come back until I am the King of Norway.&#x201d; He raised his cup toward Sweyn and tilted it to his mouth. <br>There was a brief hush at this, as everybody saw it was an insult, or a challenge, but then they erupted again in another great roaring and stamping all through the hall, and more outpourings of vows. Raef, who had touched nothing since the .rst cup, marked that up there at the high seat, Sweyn&#x2019;s glinting eyes were .xed on Conn and his mouth wound tight with rage. Raef thought they had all probably gotten more than they wished for in this oath- taking at Helsingor. <br>The next morning Conn woke, sprawled on his bench in the hall, and went out into the yard to piss. His head pounded and his mouth tasted evil. He could not remember much of the night before. When he turned away from the fence, Sigvaldi the Jomsviking chief was walking up to him, beaming all across his face. <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he boomed out, &#x201c;maybe we promised some mighty doings, last night, with those vows, hah? But I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re with us, boy. We&#x2019;ll see if you&#x2019;ll make a Jomsviking.&#x201d; He put out his hand to Conn, who shook it, having nothing else to do. Sigvaldi went on, &#x201c;Meet at the Limsfjord at the full moon, and we&#x2019;ll go raiding in Norway, and draw Hakon to us. Then we&#x2019;ll .nd out how well you .ght.&#x201d; <br>He tramped away across the yard, where more of the Jomsvikings were coming out into the sun. Raef stood by the door into the hall. <br>Conn went over by him. <br>&#x201c;What did I swear to?&#x201d; <br>His cousin&#x2019;s long homely face was expressionless. &#x201c;You said you would sail with them and challenge Hakon the Jarl face- to- face, and not return to Denmark until you were King of Norway.&#x201d; <br>Conn gave a yelp, amazed, and said, &#x201c;What a fool I am in beer! That&#x2019;s something great to do, though, isn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d; <br>Raef said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; Conn said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s get started.&#x201d; <br>II <br>So they sailed north to raid in Norway, around the Vik, where the riches were. Sometimes the whole .eet raided a village together, and sometimes they went out in parties and attacked farmsteads along the fjord, driving the people out and then ransacking their holdings. What ever anybody found of gold went into a great chest, which Bui the Stout guarded like a dragon. All else they ate or drank, or packed off to the Jomsberg. Several ships went heavy- laden to the Jomsberg, but there was no sign of Hakon the Jarl. <br>They turned north, following the passageways between the islands and the coast, raiding as they went. Every day the sun stayed longer in the sky, and the nights barely darkened enough to let a man sleep an hour. Around them, above thin green seaside meadows, the land rose in curtains of rock, snow- cloaked. They stood far out to sea to weather the cloud- shrouded wind- blasted cape at Stad, and then rowed on, still north but now easterly, attacking what ever they found in the fjords. They were within a few good days&#x2019; rowing now of the long waterway that led to the Trondelag, and still Hakon offered them no opposition. <br>III <br>Conn&#x2019;s muscles hurt; all day he had been rowing against the .erce north wind, and he stood on the beach and stretched the ache out of his arms. The sun was a great fat orange blob .oating just above the western horizon. The sky burned with its .ery glow, the few low streaks of cloud gilt- edged. The dark sea rolled up against the pebble shore, broke, and withdrew in a long seething growl. Out past the ships, sixty of them, drawn up onto the beach like resting monsters, he caught a glimpse of a shark. <br>The coppery light of the long sundown made the camp.res that covered the beach almost invisible. Over every pit a haunch turned, strips of meat and .sh hung dripping on tripods and spits, their fats exploding in the coals below, and a man stood by in the hot glow with a cup, putting out burns with a douse of beer. Conn saw Sigvaldi Haraldsson up on the beach and went to him. <br>The chief of the Jomsvikings sat on a big log, his feet out in front of him, watching some lesser men turn his spit. Bui the Stout sat next to him, the Jomsvikings&#x2019; trea sure chest at his feet. As Conn came up, they raised their faces toward him. They were passing a cup between them, and Sigvaldi with a bellowed greeting held it out to him. <br>Conn drank. The beer tasted muddy. &#x201c;Hakon has to come after us soon.&#x201d; <br>Sigvaldi gave a harsh crackle of a laugh, clapping his hands on his knees. &#x201c;I told you, lad, he won&#x2019;t willingly .ght us. We will have to go all the way up to the Trondelag to drag him out of his hole.&#x201d; <br>Bui laughed. &#x201c;By then we will have beggared him anyway.&#x201d; He kicked the chest at his feet. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Sigvaldi said, and reached out and slapped Conn&#x2019;s arm companionably. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve taken great boot, and we&#x2019;ll feast again to night as we do every night. This is the life of a Jomsviking, boy.&#x201d; <br>Conn blu...</p></p><h2>Adventuring Through the Bible: A Comprehensive Guide to the Entire Bible</h2><p>The Old and New Testaments come together in a unique and captivating way to show how all parts of God&#39;s Word fit together.</p><p><p>IN HIS ADVENTURE THROUGH THE BIBLE, Ray Stedman brings the Old and New Testaments together in a unique and captivating way to help you understand how all parts of God&#x2019;s Word fit together.

Yet, through faith, he matured into one the great pastors, expositors, and spiritual leaders of the twentieth century. Today&#x2019;s church is filled with pastors and leaders&#x2014;men like David Roper, Charles Swindoll, and Luis Palau&#x2014;who consider him their mentor and lifelong friend.<p></p>Ray was a man&#x2019;s man, who ended up being the father of four daughters. He and his family lived through the turbulent era of the 1960s and the Jesus Movement, a time of turmoil and heartache for Ray and his wife, Elaine, and a remarkable time of growth and expansion in his own ministry.<p></p>Biblical teaching (exposition) was Ray&#x2019;s calling and his passion, and he motivated people by the power of the preaching of the Word of God. He also inspired and taught many through the written word. With over nineteen books to his credit, from <i>Spiritual Warfare</i> to his insightful commentary <i>Adventuring Through the Bible</i>, Stedman&#x2019;s published works span the experiences of Christian life, including <i>Body Life</i>, a book that had tremendous impact on the church in the twentieth century.<p></p>Ray Stedman&#x2019;s preeminent goal was to be a faithful steward of the gifts God had given him.

A stunning tale of mystery and suspense, this classic from the beloved, Edgar� Award-winning author once again leads readers down the gritty streets of Philadelphia and into the offices of the law firm of Rosato &amp; Associates. When a new client who&#x2019;s been accused of murder&#x2014;and who bears an astonishing resemblance to Bennie Rosato&#x2014;asks the crusading criminal defense attorney to take her case, Bennie finds herself entangled in a sticky web of murder, corruption, and violence that threatens to reveal the shocking truth about her own past. If you haven&#x2019;t read Lisa Scottoline before, <em>Mistaken Identity</em> will prove to you what her many fans already know: nobody does it better!<br></p></p><p>When confronted with the most challenging and the most personal case of her legal career, Bennie Rosato--an expert on police corruption--questions everything she has learned as a criminal attorney, and everyone she considers to be family. During a visit behind the bars of Philadelphia's Central Corrections facility, Bennie is shocked to discover that an inmate bears a striking physical resemblance to herself. The prisoner, Alice Connolly, stands accused of murdering her cop boyfriend Anthony Della Porta, and the case reeks of a police conspiracy. Connolly convinces Bennie to defend her in court. Bennie feels confused, intrigued, and even somewhat elated by this clone of herself, and dives head first into a bubbling cauldron of corruption, drugs, murder, and assault--mixed in with a thought-provoking subplot that questions the intricacies of legal ethics. <p> <i>Mistaken Identity</i> is Lisa Scottoline's sixth and tastiest dish yet. The book is gripping and smart, and it brings into bloom the highly likable character of Bennie Rosato, who made her debut appearance in <i>Legal Tender</i>. Bennie has her vulnerable moments--we witness this when, in some emotional scenes, she doubts the authenticity of her twin. Still, Ms. Rosato is no shrinking violet, especially when it comes to exposing the questionable goings-on of Philadelphia's Eleventh Precinct. </p><p> Scottoline keeps us in a bubble of suspense--is Connolly really Bennie's twin? Did she murder Della Porta? If not, who did and why? The author neatly ties all our unanswered questions together into a perfectly formed bow, and keeps us frantically turning pages until the very end. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Lisa Scottoline continues to enthrall a growing legion of critics and fans with her superb talent for creating gripping, unpredictable stories that rival the best of John Grisham, Scott Turow, and Richard North Patterson. Filled with twisting plots, unforgettable flesh-and-blood characters, and absorbing dramatic tension, her previous national bestsellers have propelled her into the top ranks of legal suspense. Now, this acclaimed author is back with <em>Mistaken Identity,</em> her most thoughtful, riveting, and richest novel yet. <p> Life holds few surprises for Bennie Rosato, head of her own Philadelphia law firm. As a criminal attorney now specializing in police misconduct cases, she's seen the noblest and most deviant aspects of human nature. But nothing can prepare her for the moment she enters a maximum-security prison to meet her new client, Alice Connolly, face to face. Accused of brutally murdering her lover, a highly decorated police detective, Connolly claims the police framed her. A defendant protesting her innocence is not unusual for Bennie. What shocks her is that Connelly bears an uncanny physical resemblance to her. "Pleased to meet you. I'm your twin. Your identical twin," Connolly tells the astonished lawyer. But Bennie grew up as an only child, or so she thought. She has a law firm, a handsome young lover, and a golden retriever; she doesn't have a twin. Or does she? </p><p> Connolly knows too many intimate details about Bennie's life and family for the resemblance to be just coincidental. And there is something about the woman that compels the intrigued attorney to defend her, against her better judgment. Taking the case with the trial only a week away, Bennie plunges into the mystery of the murder, as well as her own identity and her family's dark secrets. Is Connolly innocent? And is she Bennie's unknown sister? It is not until Bennie takes the case to verdict that she will finally learn the truth, which threatens to change her life. </p><p> A legal thriller, a courtroom drama, and an exploration of the emotional bonds that define our lives and those we love, <em>Mistaken Identity</em> is a masterful achievement that takes the legal thriller to a new level as it resoundingly confirms Lisa Scottoline's place as one of the premier writers of suspense fiction today.</p></p><h2>Building the Maine Guide Canoe</h2><p>The definitive guide to building this classic watercraft.

Echoing the voice of A.A. Milne and illustrated in the style of E.H. Shepard, this new volume invites readers to "join Winnie-the-Pooh for a year of adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood." In autumn, Pooh and Piglet fear a "mithickle" dragon is about to invade the forest. The chronicle continues into winter, when a shy and proper penguin who needs "Bringing Out of Himself" visits. In spring, Eeyore worries that "Another Donkey" has come to steal his thistles. Finally, Pooh and Piglet go in search of "the Sauce" of the river that runs through the Wood in summer. With the assistance of Christopher Robin and his animal friends, Pooh optimistically stumps through the forest seeking a solution to each tale's dilemma. The changing seasons are captured in idyllic, sunlit illustrations sprinkled throughout the text. Beginning with the eye-catching endpapers, Burgess deftly portrays life in the Hundred Acre Wood and the friendship enjoyed by Pooh, Piglet, and all the other familiar characters. The evocative visuals perfectly complement the gentle and amusing narrative. In an engaging afterword, Bright, Sibley, Willis, Saunders, and Burgess reflect on their childhood memories of the "Bear of Little Brain." VERDICT Replete with Pooh's wise insights about the simple things in life, this collection will delight a new generation of readers.&#x2014;Linda L.

She currently provides workshops, not only for the general public, but also for a wide variety of organizations, including: small businesses; corporations, such as Hewlett Packard and Nordstrom; educational institutions, ranging from public schools (K-12) to universities such as Stanford and the University of California, San Francisco; government organizations, such as The Smithsonian and the Justice Department; health care organizations, and social service agencies. An award winning speaker, Sharon also provides keynotes and workshops at conferences internationally.Great career books, favorite choices for this year: Ellison's work does not focus on career development per se but rather on communication skills. I think she supports people in learning and practicing communication skills that are both effective and increase mutual respect. She raises the negotiation playing field above the gritty fear and defensiveness of street fights and turf wars. -- <i>San Jose Mercury News</i><br><br>WAR OF THE WORDS: The premise is powerful: Human communication has been "shaped by our focus on defensive self-protection and power struggle. Because we use them (words) as weapons instead of constructive tools, we often communicate in a way that increases conflict instead of resolving it." A therapist turned communications seminarian, Ms. Ellison explains how disarming your questions and making direct statements can guide exchanges toward neutral ground. Control-oriented readers will have a hard time with this, but Ms. Ellison says what's gained through transparency more than compensates for surrendered power [struggle]. Her ideas are striking. -- <i>Dallas Morning News</i><br><br>With remarkable clarity, Sharon demonstrates how our verbal communication has, for centuries, been based on a "war model." Thus we become defensive easilywhether we want simply to protect ourselves, or to work toward social change. We cause needless power struggles and pain, even with those we love most. Sharon describes our six common defensive modes and how we communicate in manipulative and controlling ways, even when we have the best of intentions. In the remaining two-thirds of the book, she describes a method of listening and speaking which can give each of us clarity, confidence and power, regardless of whether others cooperate or not. It is a disarming, freeing, and contagious process, which can transform our individual lives and be a potent tool for social change. -- <i>Common Ground Magazine</i></p><h2>The Presidents Club: Inside the World&#39;s Most Exclusive Fraternity</h2><p>The inside story of the world&#39;s most exclusive fraternity; how presidents from Hoover through Obama worked with--and sometimes, against--each other when they were in and out of power.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2012</strong>: It's hard to imagine a more obviously fascinating prism through which to look at American history and politics since the end of World War II. Starting with the surprisingly effective relationship of Harry S. Truman and Herbert Hoover, and following through "Obama and His Club," <em>TIME Magazine</em>'s Executive Editor Nancy Gibbs and Washington Bureau Chief Michael Duffy trace the surprising, complicated story of "the world's most exclusive fraternity." Sitting presidents and their predecessors have at times proved remarkably simpatico, at others impossible thorns in each other's sides.

It&#x2019;s hard to tell how much time passes &#x201c;inside the story,&#x201d; because in Roland Deschain&#x2019;s <i>where</i> and <i>when,</i> both time and direction have become plastic.1 Outside the story&#x2014;in what we laughingly call &#x201c;the real world&#x201d;&#x2014;thirty-two years passed between the first sentence and the last one.<br> <br>How long were the lapses between the individual books that make up the entire story? In truth, Constant Reader, I do not know. I think the longest lapse might have been six years (between <i>The Waste Lands</i> and <i>Wizard and Glass</i>). It is a miracle the story was ever finished at all, but perhaps an even greater one that a second volume ever followed the first, which was originally published in a tiny edition by Donald M. Grant, Publishers.2 The manuscript of that first volume, wet and barely readable, was rescued from a mildewy cellar. The first forty handwritten pages of a second volume (titled, as I remember, <i>Roland Draws Three</i>) were missing. God knows where they wound up.<br> <br>Will I tell you what happens to a story when it lies fallow over such long periods of time? Will you hear? Then close your eyes and imagine a vast department store, all on one level, lit by great racks of overhead fluorescent lights. You see every kind of item under those lights&#x2014;underwear and automotive parts, TVs and DVDs, shoes and stationery and bikes for the kiddies, blue jeans and mattresses <i>(Oh look, Herbie, they&#x2019;re on sale, 40% off!),</i> cosmetics and air rifles, party dresses and picnic gear.<br> <br>Now imagine the lights failing, one by one. The huge space grows darker; the goods so temptingly arrayed grow dimmer and harder to see. Finally you can hardly see your hand in front of your face.<br> <br>That was the kind of room I came to when it was finally time to write <i>The Drawing of the Three,</i> except then the store wasn&#x2019;t so big&#x2014;the first volume was less than three hundred pages long, so it was actually more of a mom n pop operation, do ya not see it. I was able to light it again simply by reading over the first volume and having a few ideas (I also resurrected a few old ones; I hadn&#x2019;t entirely forgotten what was in those handwritten pages, or the purpose of the tale).<br> <br>Coming back to write the third volume <i>(The Waste Lands)</i> in the mid-eighties was harder, because the store was once again almost completely dark, and now it was much bigger. Once again I began by reading over what I&#x2019;d written, taking copious notes, and filling paperback copies of the first two books with yellow highlighted passages and pink Post-it notes.<br> <br>Another four years passed . . . or perhaps this time it was six. The store had once again grown dark, and by the time I was ready to write <i>Wizard and Glass,</i> it was bigger than ever. This time I wanted to add a whole new annex (call it Roland&#x2019;s Past instead of the Bridal Shoppe). Once again out came the books&#x2014;three of them, this time&#x2014;the yellow highlighter, and the packets of Post-it notes.<br> <br>When I sat down to complete Roland&#x2019;s story in the year 2001, I knew that just rereading and writing myself Post-it notes wouldn&#x2019;t be enough. By now the store that was my story seemed to cover whole acres; had become a Wal-Mart of the imagination. And, were I to write three more volumes, I&#x2019;d be adding dozens of characters (I actually ended up adding more than fifty), a whole new dialect (based on the pidgin English used by the natives of West Africa and first encountered by me in Richard Dooling&#x2019;s extraordinary <i>White Man&#x2019;s Grave</i>), and a backstory that would&#x2014;I hoped&#x2014;finally make Roland&#x2019;s wandering present clear to the patient reader.<br> <br>This time, instead of reading, I listened to Frank Muller&#x2019;s extraordinary audio recordings of the first four Dark Tower stories. Unabridged audio forces the reader to slow down and listen to every word, whether he or she wants to or not. It also lends a new perspective, that of the reader and the audio director. But I knew even that would not be enough. I needed some sort of exhaustive written summary of <i>everything</i> that had gone before, a Dark Tower concordance that would be easy to search when I needed to find a reference in a hurry. In terms of the store metaphor, I needed someone to replace all the fluorescents, and inventory all the goods on offer, and then hand me a clipboard with everything noted down.<br> <br>Enter Robin Furth. She came to me courtesy of my old friend and teacher at the University of Maine, Burton Hatlen. Burt is a wonderful scholar of poetry and popular fiction. He has written about Roland for several scholarly journals, and was sympathetic to what I was up to with the books (indeed, he seemed to understand what I was up to better than I did myself). So I gave him my list of requirements with some confidence (some hope, at least) that he would find the right person.<br> <br>Someone who was bright and imaginative.<br> <br>Someone who had read a good deal of fantasy (although not necessarily the Tower books themselves), and was therefore familiar with its rather unique language and thematic concerns.<br> <br>Someone who could write with clarity and verve.<br> <br>Someone who was willing to work hard and answer arcane and often bizarre questions <i>(Who was the mayor of New York in 1967? Do worms have teeth?)</i> on short notice.<br> <br>He found Robin Furth, and my wandering gunslinger had found his Boswell. The concordance you hold in your hands&#x2014;and which will surely delight you as it has delighted me&#x2014;was never written to be published. As a writer I like to fly by the seat of my pants, working without an outline and usually without notes. When I have to slow down to look for something&#x2014;a name in Volume III, say, or a sequence of events way back in Volume I&#x2014;I can almost <i>feel</i> the story growing cold, the edge of my enthusiasm growing blunt and flecking out with little blooms of rust. The idea of the concordance was to limit these aggravating pauses by putting Roland&#x2019;s world at my fingertips&#x2014;not just names and places, but slang terms, dialects, relationships, even whole chronologies.<br> <br>Robin provided exactly what I needed, and more. One day I walked into my office to discover her down on her knees, carefully sticking photographs to a huge piece of poster paper. It was, she explained, a &#x201c;walking tour&#x201d; of Second Avenue in New York, covering the avenue itself and all the cross streets from Fortieth to Sixty-sixth. There was the U.N. Plaza Hotel (which has changed its name twice since I started writing Roland&#x2019;s story); there was Hammarskj�ld Plaza (which did not even exist back in 1970); there was the spot where Tom and Jerry&#x2019;s Artistic Deli (&#x201c;Party Platters Our Specialty&#x201d;) once stood. That poster eventually went up on the wall of my writing room in Florida, and was of invaluable help in writing <i>Song of Susannah</i> (The Dark Tower VI). In addition to the &#x201c;walking tour&#x201d; itself, Robin had patiently winkled out the history of the key two blocks, including the real shops and buildings I&#x2019;d replaced with such fictional bits of real estate as Chew Chew Mama&#x2019;s and The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind. And it was Robin who discovered that, across the street from 2 Hammarskj�ld Plaza, there really is a little pocket park (it&#x2019;s called a &#x201c;peace garden&#x201d;) that does indeed contain a bronze turtle sculpture. Talk about life imitating art!<br> <br>As I say, her concordance was never meant to be published; it was created solely as a writer&#x2019;s tool. But, even with most of my mind preoccupied by the writing of my tale, I was aware of how good it was, how interesting and <i>readable</i> it was. I also became aware, as time passed and the actual publication of the final three volumes grew closer, of how valuable it might be to the Constant Reader who&#x2019;d read the first three or four volumes of the series, but some years ago.<br> <br>In any case, it was Robin Furth who inventoried the goods I had on sale, and replaced all the dim overhead lights so I could see everything clearly and find my way from Housewares to Appliances without getting lost . . . or from Gilead to Calla Bryn Sturgis, if you prefer. That in no way makes her responsible for my errors&#x2014;of which I&#x2019;m sure there are many&#x2014;but it <i>is</i> important that she receive credit for all the good work she has done on my behalf. I found this overview of In-World, Mid-World, and End-World both entertaining and invaluable.<br> <br>So, I am convinced, will you.<br> <br>January 26, 2003|<b>INTRODUCTION PART TWO<br> VOLUMES V&#x2013;VII<br> FOUR CHARACTERS (AND A BUMBLER) IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR: OR, A FEW REFLECTIONS ON THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN FICTION AND REALITY</b><br> <br><i>Spoiler&#x2019;s Warning: This</i> Concordance <i>keeps no secrets. Read it only after you have finished all seven of the Dark Tower books.</i><br> <br>For those of us who have traveled with Roland Deschain from the wastes of the Mohaine Desert to the Castle of the Crimson King and then beyond, to the farthest reaches of End-World, the journey has been a long one, say thankya. For many Constant Readers, it has taken more than twenty years; for <i>sai</i> King, the travels have spanned more than thirty. And for Roland, who is able to leap over whole generations in pursuit of his quarry and his quest, the pilgrimage has lasted more than three hundred.8 Yet as Eddie Dean points out at the beginning of <i>Wolves of the Calla,</i> time is elastic. Despite what we&#x2019;ve been told about the accuracy of clocks, no two sixty-second periods are ever identical. Although a minute may move like dried mud while we&#x2019;re waiting or when we&#x2019;re bored, it speeds to the point of invisibility when we&#x2019;re in the throes of change. And what is a novel but a tale of transformation and discovery?<br> <br>Over the course of the Dark Tower series, we witness tremendous transformation, both in our characters&#x2019; natures and in the parameters of their quest. What began, in <i>The Gunslinger,</i> as the story of one man&#x2019;s obsessive pursuit of a goal becomes, in the final three books of our story, a tale of personal, and universal, redemption. By the time we reach the final page of our saga, we have witnessed so much. Roland, once a lone traveler willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to the achievement of his end, has drawn three companions to him9 and has trained them to be gunslingers. With his new <i>tet</i>-mates, Roland discovers the Bear-Turtle Beam and follows it to the haunted regions of End-World, where the Dark Tower sits. Along the Path of the Beam, the bonds of <i>khef,</i> which unite his new <i>ka-tet,</i> are tested and proved strong. And Roland, always an emotionally reticent man, rediscovers his ability to trust and to love. With this newfound knowledge, he can finally admit, and repent, all of his previous betrayals.<br> <br>In many ways, the Dark Tower series falls into two parts: the adventures that Roland and his companions have in Mid-World (all of which were written before Stephen King&#x2019;s accident in 1999) and those that take place in the borderlands and End-World, which were penned after our author began to recover from the accident that almost claimed his life. The adventures our <i>ka-mates</i> have in both halves of their tale are dramatic, but the nature of the changes they undergo as a result are quite different. In the first four Tower books, the transformations our <i>tet</i> experiences are, in large part, personal. As well as bonding as a group, united in their vision of one day reaching the Dark Tower, each member has to battle his or her own demons. Eddie overcomes heroin addiction. Susannah&#x2019;s dual personalities of Detta and Odetta merge into a unified whole. Jake abandons his lonely life in New York to join his adopted father&#x2019;s quest, and Roland, who up until this point has been a self-obsessed loner, learns to value his <i>tet</i> as highly as he values his search for the linchpin of existence.10 Yet if the first four Dark Tower books are about the <i>khef</i>11 that binds self to <i>ka-tet,</i> in the final three novels, the responsibilities of <i>khef</i> ripple outward, encompassing not just the debt the individual owes to his <i>tet</i>-mates but the responsibilities each of us has to the greater world&#x2014;or, in the case of the Dark Tower series, to the multiple worlds.<br> <br>In the final three books of the Dark Tower series, Roland and his friends extend the scope of their quest. While keeping their ultimate goal in mind, they set out to accomplish a number of specific tasks that, when taken together, simultaneously halt the erosion of the Beams, frustrate the apocalyptic plans of the Crimson King, and work for the common good. First, in <i>Wolves of the Calla,</i> they destroy the robotic, green-cloaked horsemen who have been stealing children from Mid-World&#x2019;s borderlands for more than six generations.12 By so doing, they not only liberate the people of the Callas but undermine the efficiency of the Breakers&#x2014;those prisoners of the Crimson King who have been forced to erode the Beams with the equivalent of psychic battery acid. Second, in <i>Song of Susannah,</i> Jake and Callahan manage to put Black Thirteen, the most evil of Maerlyn&#x2019;s magic balls, out of commission. And third, with the help of John Cullum (their Stoneham, Maine, <i>dan-tete</i>), Roland and Eddie begin to lay plans for the Tet Corporation, a company created to undermine the powers of the evil Sombra Corporation and to protect both the wild Rose, found in New York City&#x2019;s Vacant Lot, and our <i>kas-ka Gan,</i> Stephen King, creator of our tale.13<br> <br>By accomplishing these tasks, our <i>tet</i> remains true to the Way of Eld, which demands that gunslingers protect the weak and vulnerable from those who would oppress or exploit them. Yet in defending the White against the ever-encroaching tide of the Outer Dark, our <i>tet</i> (like our author) comes under the shadow of <i>ka-shume,</i> the shadow of death.14 In <i>The Dark Tower,</i> Roland and his friends destroy the Devar-Toi, or Breaker prison, and free the Breakers.15 They halt the erosion of the Beams (which we are assured will regenerate), but Eddie Dean pays for this victory with his life. Not long after, when Roland and Jake travel to the year 1999 so that they can save their maker, Stephen King, from his predetermined collision with a Dodge minivan, Jake Chambers heaves his last breath. It seems that <i>ka</i> demands a life for a life, and though Stephen King survives his terrible accident, Jake does not.<br> <br>And it is here, on Slab City Hill in Lovell, Maine, by the prostrate and profoundly injured body of our <i>kas-ka Gan,</i> and by the side of our gunslinger Roland, who grieves over the corpse of his adopted son, that I would like to pause. It is not a comfortable place to be&#x2014;either for <i>sai</i> King, who lies bleeding in a ditch, or for us, who are unable to help&#x2014;but it is an important place. Like Detta Walker&#x2019;s <i>Drawers,</i> this little patch of road in the year 1999 (when the <i>ka</i> of our world and the <i>ka</i> of Roland&#x2019;s world are united) is a place of power. It is a doorway between the rational and irrational worlds, a place where the veil is at its thinnest. And it is in this place where life and death meet that Roland accomplishes something worth discussing. By sacrificing what he loves above all else in order to save the life of the man who created his universe&#x2014;a man who must live if the story of the Dark Tower is to exist in any world&#x2014;Roland does what we assume is impossible. He stops the wheel of <i>ka</i> and alters its path.<br> <br>Throughout the fina...</p><h2>Blood Trails (The Searchers)</h2><p><br><br>Her "father's" deathbed confession reveals that Holly's real father was almost certainly the notorious serial killer known as "The Hunter," and that her mother gave Holly up to save her life.

It should have been filled with energy and activity&#x2014;voices, snippets of conversation and laughter, the scent of something good baking in the oven.<br><br>But Andrew Slade's death had been the beginning of the end of what had been. There was nothing to be done now but look toward what was&#x2014;or, in the case of his three daughters, what <em>could</em> be. The revelation he'd dropped on them at the reading of his will had torn the family apart.<br><br>His oldest daughter, Holly, was the only one of them left at the ranch now, along with Robert Tate, Andrew's best friend and ranch foreman&#x2014;and the love of Holly's life.<br><br>But Robert&#x2014;Bud to his friends&#x2014;didn't know about Holly's feelings, and she was so used to keeping them a secret that revealing them now in the midst of so much turmoil didn't seem possible.<br><br>Her sisters, Maria and Savannah, were already gone. They'd jumped into the search for answers to their pasts without hesitation, while Holly had lingered. She couldn't wrap her head around what she'd learned without getting sick to her stomach. Even now, when she should have been making travel plans, she was still at the Triple S&#x2014;still wavering as to what she should do and replaying the video that had ripped their world apart when they'd gathered in the office of their lawyer, Cole-man Rice, and seen it for the first time.<br><br>She sat now within the quiet of the family den while a log burned and popped in the fireplace behind her, her gaze fixed on the television, and re-watched the video. As soon as it ended, she played it again. Andrew's image and voice were a source of comfort, but at the same time they fed her grief.<br><br><em>"Hello, my daughters. Obviously, if you 're seeing this, I have passed on. Know that, while I am sorry to be leaving you behind, my faith in God and the knowledge that I will be with my beloved Hannah again is, for me, a cause to rejoice. However, what I have to say to you is something I've dreaded your entire lives, and I'm ashamed to say I chose the easy way out and left it for you to hear after my passing."</em><br><br>Holly held her breath. This time she knew what was coming, but the words were still impossible to absorb.<br><br><em>"My darling daughters...you need to know that I am not really your father, Hannah was not really your mother, nor were any of you ever legally adopted."</em><br><br>Holly jumped when she felt a hand slide across her shoulder, then swallowed past the lump in her throat to keep from crying when she realized it was Bud. Somehow he'd come in and she hadn't even heard him.<br><br><em>"There is more. You are not sisters."</em><br><br>Holly hit Pause, then clasped Bud's hand as she turned around. "Did you need me?"<br><br>A dozen thoughts of what he might say slid through Bud's mind, but the one that mattered most was one he'd never said. Yes, he needed her: in his heart, in his life, in his bed...forever. "Not really, honey. I just came in to see if you were okay."<br><br>Holly's shoulders slumped. "Obviously I'm not, or I wouldn't still be wallowing in this."<br><br>Bud slid onto the couch beside her and took her hand.<br><br>"Let it play out and then we'll talk." Holly hit Play. Andrew's voice filled the silence between them.<br><br><em>"By now, I suspect your grief at my passing has turned to shock...even anger. I understand. But what you three need to understand is...I believed with every fiber of my being that, as I was following my calling as an evangelical preacher, God led me to each of you at a time when you needed me most. There are journals that I've left with Coleman, one for each of you. Everything I know about your past is in there, along with why your mothers put you in my care.</em><br><br><em>"Maria, you were the first one. You were born Mary Blake, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Your mother had a hard life. She was, for lack of a better word, an escort at the time of her death. You were four years old when you witnessed her murder. As she lay dying, she begged me to take you and hide you. The details as to how it all happened are in your journal. To my knowledge, her murder was never solved.</em><br><br><em>"Savannah, you are actually Sarah Stewart, from Miami, Florida, and the second child to be given to me. Your mother was dying of cancer and had come to my tent meetings to pray for healing. By then Maria had been with me for nearly six months. You were barely two. You and Maria hit it off immediately when your mother came to hear me preach, and she saw the bond between you two. On the last night of the revival, she came to me in a panic. She and your father were not married, but he had never denied you, and he played an important role in your life. According to her, he was also a member of a very rich, powerful local family, and he had informed them of his plans to marry her. The night she came to me, she was sobbing uncontrollably. Your father had been killed in a car accident early that morning, and already she had received a threat on your life. Aware that she had only weeks to live and no one else to whom she could turn, she begged me to take you and raise you with Maria. So I did. It was then that I began to understand I was being led down this path by a power greater than my own.</em><br><br><em>"Holly, you are my oldest, but you came to me last."</em><br><br>Holly started to cry. Bud let go of her hand and put his arm around her shoulders, holding her close as the video continued.<br><br><em>"You were born Harriet Mackey and were five when you and your mother showed up at a revival I was holding in St. Louis, Missouri. She seemed troubled, but I thought nothing of it. At one time or another we are all troubled by something or someone. On the fourth and last night of the revival, I thought everyone was gone from the church. Maria and Savannah had gone to sleep in the pastor's office, and I was on my way to get them when your mother showed up at the door with you and a suitcase. Her story was staggering, but at that point, I didn't question God's plan. What you need to know is that she did not give you away. She was convinced that her husband, your father, was a serial killer the Missouri police had been hunting for nearly a year. She feared what the notoriety would do to your life when all was revealed, and that you would be branded as a killer's daughter. She was going to turn him in, and then come and get you and start over in a new place. Only she never came after you, and no one was ever arrested for the murders. I fear she paid for her bravery with her life.</em><br><br><em>"As I said before, Coleman has journals for each of you. I've written down everything I know. As to whether you go back to find your roots or not, that is your choice, but I caution each of you to remember, your lives were in danger then. They could be again."</em><br><br>The video ended. This time Holly turned off the TV, then covered her face.<br><br>Bud took her in his arms and began patting her back as he'd done countless times before when she'd been a child.<br><br>"I'm sorry, Holly, so sorry this is happening."<br><br>She didn't answer. The only thing she was capable of at the moment was tears, and Bud knew enough to let her cry it out.<br><br>He'd been a young man, barely out of his teens, when he'd come to work for Andrew Slade, but over the years he and Andrew had become best friends. He'd adored Andrew's girls from the start, and they'd returned the feeling. He wasn't sure when he realized his fondness for Holly had turned into something more.<br><br>Holly was twenty-five now, finally old enough for his thirty-nine years. But there were too many years of familial friendship between them for him to hope their relationship could become anything more.<br><br>Finally Holly pulled out of his embrace and reached for a handful of tissues.<br><br>"Sorry. You'd think I'd be past this by now."<br><br>"It's okay. Indecision is troubling enough on its own, without all this other crap to deal with."<br><br>Holly laughed through tears. "That's what I love about you, Bud. You always cut to the chase."<br><br>Bud's gaze was fixed on her mouth. Her lips were slightly swollen from crying and begging to be kissed. It was all he could do to back away.<br><br>"That's me&#x2014;To-the-Point Tate. And speaking of getting to the point, I came to tell you not to bother making lunch for me. I've got to take some of the hands over to the high country, and find the rest of the cows and new calves."<br><br>All of a sudden Holly had found a task that she could handle.<br><br>"There's no need going without anything to eat until night. There's a full platter of fried chicken in the refrigerator, and at least a dozen leftover biscuits. You can at least take that for you and the boys."<br><br>Bud grinned and then kissed the side of her cheek. "You're the best."<br><br>Holly's pulse surged. If she'd turned her mouth just the tiniest bit to the left, that kiss would have landed squarely on her lips.<br><br>"Give me a couple of minutes to pack it up for you."<br><br>"I'll grab a couple of six-packs of Mountain Dew, and we'll be good to go. The boys and I thank you."<br><br>Holly flew to her task, feeling a brief moment of respite from all her confusion. This home was where her heart was, and its heart was the kitchen&#x2014;Holly's favorite room.<br><br>Within minutes Bud and the food were gone, and Holly was once again alone, only this time with a better attitude.<br><br>She got a couple of cookies and a can of Pepsi, and went back into the den to get her journal&#x2014;the one Andrew had left for her alone.<br><br>She'd read it through a dozen times over in the past three days since learning the truth, and it still hadn't gotten any better. How did one go from being the oldest daughter of a respected Montana rancher to the only child of a suspected serial killer? The knot in her stomach drew tighter as she picked up the journal and took it to her room. She crawled up onto her bed with the Pepsi and cookies, and once again read the words that had officially ended her happy world.<br><br><em>You were born in St. Louis, Missouri, as Harriet Mackey, the only child of Harold and Twila Mackey. It was while I was preaching at a week-long revival that I first met your mother. She came every night and sat in the front row with you close by her side. I remember thinking her expression seemed sad, even haunted. It wasn't until later that I fully understood why. As for you, you were a very quiet child who played with Maria and Savannah during the services every night, and often fell asleep with them, tumbled up on top of each other like a bunch of worn-out puppies who' d played too hard.</em><br><br><em>The last night of the revival, your mother was back, but this time she was also carrying a suitcase, along with you. It wasn't until the services were over that I fully understood her intentions, but by then I' d already accepted that God was leading me to these desperate women who had nowhere else to turn. Your eyes were red and swollen andyou kept clinging to your mother's arm. When she explained what she wanted of me, you didn't flinch or weep...as if you already understood the need.</em><br><br><em>What you must understand is that, unlike Maria's and Savannah's mothers, yours had no intention of giving you away. She was desperate to get you out of the public eye. She claimed that she had recently come to believe that her husband was a serial killer the police were searching for, and who had been leaving women's bodies all over St. Louis for months. The police didn't have a single clue on which to act, but your mother was convinced that her husband, your father, was the man. She said she had evidence. She was going to turn him in, wait for his arrest, and then, after everything died down, she would come and get you. She had plans for the two of you to start life over under another name and in another state. But she never came. And no one was ever arrested. I could only draw one conclusion: that she 'd been murderedfor her intentions.</em><br><br>Unable to read any more, Holly laid the journal and her food aside, and curled up in the fetal position. She was still shocked that she had no memories of her parents, or of living anywhere other than the Triple S Ranch. According to the journal, she was five when her mother sent her away with Andrew Slade. So what happened? What had she seen that had been so horrible she'd been willing to block out everything, including a mother who loved her that much?<br><br></p><h2>Goodnight World: Animals of the Native Northwest</h2><p>Night-time themed artistic view of animals, fish and insects of the Northwest Coast</p><p></p><h2>Long Black Veil: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>&#x2019;s Best Books of 2017<br><br>For fans of Donna Tartt and Megan Abbott, a novel about a woman whose family and identity are threatened by the secrets of her past, f<b>rom the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>She's Not There</i></b></b><br><br>On a warm August night in 1980, six college students sneak into the dilapidated ruins of Philadelphia&#x2019;s Eastern State Penitentiary, looking for a thrill.

Instead we are ghosts: two of us dead, a third unrecognizable, a fourth suspected of murder. It would be easy enough at this hour to have contempt for those young selves, to focus instead on how much cleverer we have become here in the green pastures of the twenty-first century. But over the years I have come to believe that people are usually more deserving of forgiveness than judgment. This is not only because it&#x2019;s an act of grace; it&#x2019;s also because most men and women aren&#x2019;t afforded the luxury of dying more than once.</p><p>Unlike some people I could mention.</p><p>It was Rachel who got us out of our beds that hot August morning, even though our heads were still throbbing from the wedding the night before. But Rachel was a woman on a mission, and she&#x2019;d decided she was going to take Quentin to see <i>The Large Bathers </i>by C�zanne, or perish in the attempt. She was all about the Impressionists then. Before they graduated, when she was in her Renaissance phase, she&#x2019;d taken a crack at painting Quentin&#x2019;s portrait in the manner of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s <i>John the Baptist, </i>but instead of being flattered, he got all sore about it. <i>That&#x2019;s what you think I look like? </i>he said, hurt that she did not see him the way he saw himself. But <i>hello. </i>Of course he looked exactly like that.</p><p>Later, it had been Tripper&#x2019;s idea to walk from the Philadelphia Museum of Art to Eastern State Penitentiary. It wasn&#x2019;t far. He&#x2019;d been a history major at Wesleyan, and he&#x2019;d always wanted to check out the medieval-looking ruins. The prison had opened in 1829, and closed only eight years before, in 1972. Since then it just sat there in the heart of Philly, all boarded up, while the city tried to figure out what to do with it.</p><p>Maisie looked at the sketchy neighborhood into which they had strayed. "Do we <i>have </i>to do this?" she said. She had long blond hair and a mole in the middle of her left cheek.</p><p>"When the prison was built this was all green fields," Tripper said.</p><p>His nickname contained no small degree of irony, given that he was the most conservative of the group and the only trips he had any intention of taking were ones to the Grand Caymans. At birth he'd been chris�tened Tobin Owen Pennypacker III, though, and his father (Tobin Owen Pennypacker Jr.) had taken to calling him Triple for short. Over time, "Triple" had inevitably morphed to "Tripper."</p><p>"It's <i>not </i>a very good neighborhood," noted Maisie.</p><p>"Will ye not fuck yourself," inquired Wailer. It was a rhetorical question.</p><p>A bottle smashed in an alley behind one of the row houses to their right. "Sorry," said Maisie. "I just don't like the idea of getting mugged."</p><p>"Hey man, nobody's mugged you <i>so </i>far," said Casey. He was a gen�erously obese young man wearing a striped engineer's hat upon his head. The groom.</p><p>"But it's early yet," suggested Wailer. She was wearing black fin�gernail polish. The bride.</p><p>"No, we should keep going," said Rachel. She had a big head of bushy black hair, but even at twenty-two there were streaks of gray. "Quentin has got his heart set on the prison now." In her painting, Quentin had pointed with one hand toward the heavens. The other hovered over his heart. It was some likeness.</p><p>It was August of 1980. Carter was still president, Reagan an un�likely joke. There were hostages in Iran, fifty-two blindfolded souls. The Bicentennial, with its tall ships and fireworks, was a recent mem�ory. John Lennon was alive. Now and again there'd be a story in the news about how the Beatles were going to come together once more, perhaps in order to raise cash for some charity. Everyone figured it would happen, sooner or later. Why shouldn't they?</p><p>They were six in all, plus Krystal and the boy. Quentin and Casey and Tripper had known each other since high school, out at Devon Boys' Latin on the Main Line. Later, the three of them went to Wes�leyan, which is where they'd met Rachel and Wailer. They'd only graduated three months before, June first. Plans for the future were sketchy.</p><p>The day was hot and sticky. Their clothes stuck to their bodies.</p><p>On the street ahead, Rachel saw Quentin talking to Herr Krys�tal, his former teacher, and now his friend. The two of them had been yammering away in German all morning. It had kind of wrecked their visit to the Cezannes, in fact. All Rachel had wanted was to look upon <i>The Large Bathers </i>with Quentin, to have him see what she saw. But Quentin had hardly paid <i>The Large Bathers </i>any mind at all. Instead he just yakked away with Krystal in a language that sucked the beauty directly from the air. It was worse than the Black Speech in Tolkien. <i>Ash. na'{_g gimbatu!, </i>suggested Hitler.</p><p>Benny, Maisie's little brother, tightened his grip on her hand. The ten-year-old had a buzz cut and enormous glasses that were always on the verge of falling off of his face.</p><p>"I'm afraid of the garble," he said.</p><p>"Well, get used to it, Benny," said Tripper. There was a gold anchor embroidered on the breast pocket of his blue sport coat. "That's what the world is! Garble and gibberish."</p><p>The boy looked at him fearfully. He and Maisie had grown up in a ruined Main Line mansion, a place called the Bagatelle, out in Vil� lanova. After the exploits of their father, "Lucky" Lenfest, it was the only asset the family had left, a haunted house with a listing Victorian tower, leaking ceilings, an attic full of crap. The heart of the mansion was an elaborate spiral staircase, carved from cherry, with a pipe organ in its center. Maisie was the only one of them who hadn't been at Wes� leyan. She'd gone to Conestoga High, out in Berwyn, and dated Trip� per- a scandal, given Tripper's natural predilection for debutantes.</p><p>She'd wound up at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, studying organ and harpsichord.</p><p>At the wedding the night before, Wailer had come down the cherry staircase of the Bagatelle in her bridal gown as Maisie played "A Whiter Shade of Pale" on the organ. Casey stood at the bottom of the steps, best man Quentin at his side, watching the bride descend. As she drew near him, tears of joy had spilled over Casey's eyelashes and rolled down his cheeks. Wailer's parents had not come to the wedding, being dead.</p><p>A half a block ahead of them, Quentin and Herr Krystal started singing. It was the Marlene Dietrich song from <i>The Blue Angel. </i>Quen�tin had gotten Rachel to watch <i>The Blue Angel </i>with him one night, in the same way that she had perhaps tried to get him to look at <i>The Large Bathers. </i>The film had seemed to demonstrate some verity of the world , in Quentin's eyes. But all that Rachel could see was a bunch of proto� Nazis, intent on breaking one another's hearts.</p><p>"Man," said Casey. "It's just like old times, the two of them, makin' sauerkraut. It's like we're in the Time Tunnell"</p><p>"Jonny hand meyer pocketknife, will you?"</p><p>"What?" said Casey. He reached into his pocket, but his knife was gone. "Wait, no! It's gone!"</p><p>Benny held up the jackknife. It bore the initials]. <i>C. </i>"I played a trick on you," he said.</p><p>"Benny," said Maisie. "What did we say about the stealing?" Benny wasn't moved. Casey took the knife and handed it to his bride.</p><p>"You're a criminal, little dude."</p><p>Benny pushed his glasses up his nose and smiled, satisfied.</p><p>Krystal and Quentin laughed at something in the Black Speech. Herr Krystal's hand was placed gently on Quentin's back. <i>"Wunderbar.l Wunderbar.l" </i>Krystal shouted.</p><p>"Bloody hell," muttered Wailer.</p><p>Since graduation three months earlier, Quentin had been living in his high school bedroom. He'd majored in modern foreign languages at Wesleyan, and was supposedly immersed in a project translating Walt Whitman into German. It didn't sound like he'd gotten very far though. He was going to call it <i>Die Whitman Anthologie, </i>which, as Tripper liked to point out, translated, sadly, as <i>The Whitman Sampler. </i>Rachel worried about Quentin, who'd seemed to have the greatest promise of their group, but since graduation the young man's boat had appeared to become hopelessly lodged upon the rocks.</p><p>"I want a kitty, can I have one?" said Benny.</p><p>"What?" said Maisie. She wasn't certain whether he was serious. Sometimes her little brother had sudden whims. "Do you think you're old enough?"</p><p>"It's a lot of responsibility, taking care of a cat," added Tripper. With his forefingers the boy picked at the cuticles of this thumbs.</p><p>There was a small wound on each thumb where he'd made himself bleed.</p><p>Quentin and Krystal stopped singing and stood still. Slowly, the</p><p>others came up behind them. There they were: the eight of them, gath� ered together like the members of an a cappella group. Before them rose the high walls of old, abandoned Eastern State Penitentiary. There were arrow-slit windows, turrets at the corners. A central guard tower, covered with rust, looked down upon the ruins.</p><p>Tripper raised an eyebrow. He hadn't expected it to be quite so gruesome. Quentin pointed excitedly. "The entrance is around the side." "Entrance?" said Casey.</p><p>"We don't have to go in," said Quentin. "Just look."</p><p>Herr Krystal nodded. "Hermann Hesse said that the eyes of oth�ers are our prisons, their thoughts our cages." He was tall and thin and infirm, like a human who had somehow come down with Dutch elm disease. Even though he wasn't the boys' teacher anymore, Krystal acted a lot of the time like he was still taking attendance.</p><p>"I need me fuckin' snorkel," said Wailer. "It's got so bloody deep."</p><p>They walked up the block toward the prison's old stone gates. As they walked, Maisie imagined the Rosalyn Tureck version of the Gold� berg Variations in her head, which she preferred to the Glenn Gould, on account of the groaning. Over the years, the Bach had been the music she turned to in an emergency, producing in her a calm in the face of chaos. But staring up at the towers of the old penitentiary, the Bach wasn't much help. There were some things that music was no match for, and a horrible abandoned prison was one of them.</p><p>They reached the gates. Clouds gathered in the sky above them.</p><p>Benny looked fearfully toward his sister.</p><p><i>"Maisie," </i>he said, his voice trembling.</p><p>There was a creak as Quentin pressed forward on the iron door. Gently, it swung open.</p><p>For a moment they all stood there in silence, looking at the long</p><p>stone room just beyond. There was light at its far end, where a small set of stairs led out into the old prison yard. Twenty pairs of eyes peered back at them.</p><p><i>"Miao," </i>said the creatures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Cold River, Maine</p><p>September 2015</p><p>The house was dark. &#x201c;Gollum,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He waddled over and looked up at me with his sad, bulbous eyes. His tail thumped once against the tile floor.</p><p>&#x201c;Good boy,&#x201d; I said, and kneeled down to hug him. He groaned piteously.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s go up.&#x201d; I left my suitcase at the bottom of the stairs. The old black lab&#x2014;eleven years old now&#x2014;followed me up the steps, then doddered over to our bed. Jake wasn&#x2019;t in it, off at a fire I figured. Gollum jumped in, as if it were the last action he would commit upon this Earth. The dog glanced at me with his rheumy, grateful eyes, then lay his head down on my husband&#x2019;s pillow and moaned. <i>Gollum, Gollum.</i></p><p>A pair of loons called to each other out on the lake, the bird-world equivalent of a married couple&#x2019;s late-night argument&#x2014;the male laugh- ing, the female responding with a melancholy <i>hoo</i>. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to translate: <i>I&#x2019;m here, I&#x2019;m here, are you listening, I&#x2019;m here! </i>And the reply, <i>Yeah, I know where you are.</i></p><p>I crossed the hallway to the room where our son, Falcon, lay in his bed fully dressed, arms spread like a man on the cross. His mouth was open. I stood in his doorway. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long now before he graduated, another nine months, and then Jake and I would be alone in the big house. On his desk Falcon&#x2019;s schoolbooks were piled high. His French horn lay by the foot of the bed, the case open, a music stand over by the window.</p><p>Once, he'd been a two-year-old, lying in a crib in a room not un� like this one. Back then I feared that the slightest breeze might carry him off. There had been days when I'd stood by the crib, my heart filled with equal measures wonder and fear. The sunlight had slanted through the window and reflected off of the pumpkin pine floorboards, filling his room with golden light.</p><p>Back in my bedroom, I put on a green cotton nightie with a silk� screen of a baleen whale on it, and got into bed next to Collum. Now deep into his dotage, the black lab's face was mostly gray. I turned off the light and lay there for a moment, wondering if my mind was going to be able to slow down. I'd woken that morning in a hotel room in Manhattan, after two days of researching a story on Hart Island, the Potters Field of New York. I don't know why I thought the Hart Island story was going to go anywhere: it wasn't exactly the kind of story magazines use to fill what they call the blue pages-photos of Caribbean oceans, models luxuriating in infinity pools. Some of the things I'd seen on Hart Island were going to be hard to forget: prison�ers in orange jumpsuits, coffins in a long trench, white guards with ma� chine guns trained on black men. Even the landscape was gruesome: the summer sun shining down on the deteriorating buildings of the abandoned hospital for the insane. I'd stood for a while in front of a collapsed structure filled with rusted gears and steam engines. There was a rusted sign: THE DYNAMO ROOM.</p><p>I'd begun the day in the Algonquin, had breakfast down in the lobby, and looked over my notes, trying to figure out the hook for the story. A cat crawled around my ankles and then hopped up on the couch. Steam rose from my coffee cup.</p><p>Later, I made my way to LaGuardia. It was there, as I waited to be X-rayed by security, that I saw the headline on the front of the <i>Post, </i>and the photograph of the unearthed corpse. A sophomore from Penn named Shannon Savage had found it, an intern on an archeology proj�ect at Eastern State Penitentiary, and she'd been digging around in one of the rooms in Cell Block 5. The skull had rolled out of the wall and stopped at her feet. She'd picked up the skull for a moment and held it Yorick-style, not believing it was real.</p><p>The photo in the <i>Post </i>was grisly, a close-up of the skull. It didn't look like the person I had known.</p><p>Of course, we'd always assumed that the day had ended in murder. So no, it wasn't exactly a surprise. But it had taken all these years for the corpse to turn up, and it was still shocking. Standing there in the line at LaGuardia, I felt all the hairs on my arm stand up. This was it. It was all going to get churned up again.</p><p>A TSA agent yanked me out offline and said, <i>You've been selected for</i> <i>extra screening, ma'am.</i>I know these things are random, but i...</p></p><h2>Pearl Harbor Child : A Child&#39;s View of Pearl Harbor from Attack to Peace</h2><p>Offers a child&#39;s view of the war efforts in Hawaii, from her family&#39;s move to Pearl Harbor and the impact of the December 7, 1941, attack through the end of the war.</p><p>Dorinda has been published in numerous newspapers, writing general stories about Hawaii as well as her experiences during and after the Pearl Harbor attack. Recently, she was featured in a PEOPLE magazine article about Pearl Harbor survivors, and has been interviewed numerous times on radio and television, describing her WWII experiences. <p>She originated the concept for a woman's organizational calendar, which was published by Hallmark for many years. She also has written scripts for award-winning educational films about Hawaii. PEARL HARBOR CHILD is her first book.</p>In writing this book, my mission was to share my story with the children of America, most of whom have fortunately not experienced bombing attacks and strafing of their homes. But I did. As a young child, I stood in my front yard with my family, and watched the attack until the military made us leave the harbor and seek shelter further inland. We ended up in a sugar cane field in the hills above Pearl Harbor, where we watched the attack continue, with huge plumes of black smoke rising into the skies above the burning waters dotted with sinking and damaged ships of our crippled naval fleet. <p>It was an absolutely unforgettable spectacle, and the sights, sounds and smells of that day will always be with me.</p></p><h2>A Wizard of Earthsea</h2><p>A Wizard of Earthsea [Mass Market Paperback] [Jan 01, 1979] Leguin, Ursula K. ...</p><p></p><h2>Something Fishy At Macdonald Hall (Bruno and Boots)</h2><p>When the practical jokes go too far causing Bruno and Boots to be falsely blamed, the boys know they have to put an end to the madness and catch the mystery person behind the irritating pranks. Reprint.</p><p>Grade 5-8?Bruno and Boots, practical jokers extraordinaire at a Canadian boarding school, return in this seventh book starring the popular duo. Just as headmaster William "The Fish" Sturgeon considers retiring because there are no surprises left at Macdonald Hall, a wave of pranks opens the school year, from water balloons bursting in science class to blue dye in the swimming pool. Fingers point to Bruno and Boots as the prime suspects, but this time it's a phantom practical joker who is to blame. As their gags come back to haunt them, the roommates must find out who is trying to frame them and why. When the identity of the true culprit is revealed, readers will be just as surprised as Bruno and Boots. Fans of the series will delight in another tale of madcap humor, peopled with some of the funniest, most ridiculous adults in middle-grade fiction.?Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-6. The fact that this is the seventh book about Bruno and Boots, roommates and troublemakers at Macdonald Hall boarding school, indicates that boarding-school fiction is a hardy perennial. The plot is tried-and-true: rules are bent and broken, and there's sneaking around after dark. This year, however, there's another prankster at school, and Boots and Bruno spend most of the time trying to prove their innocence by finding the guilty party. Incidents move along rapidly, and the lack of substance won't deter a reluctant reader in search of laughs. <i>Mary Harris Veeder</i></p><h2>The House We Grew Up in</h2><p>Title: The House We Grew Up in Binding: Hardcover Author: LisaJewell Publisher: AtriaBooks</p><p>Lisa Jewell is the internationally bestselling author of eighteen novels, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Then She Was Gone</i>, as well as <i>I Found You</i>, <i>The Girls in the Garden</i>, and <i>The House We Grew Up In</i>.

The Barbour and natty waistcoat in your profile photo make you look more like a Rupert or a Henry, something serious with two syllables, you know! And talking of syllables, and since you asked, no, I&#x2019;m not really called Rainbowbelle. OF COURSE NOT! I&#x2019;m called Lorelei and my name has three or four syllables, depending on how you say it. (My parents named us after mythical maidens. My sister is called Pandora. There was an Athena, but she was stillborn, so you know.) Anyway. Lor-a-lay-ee. Or Lor-a-lay. I&#x2019;m not fussy really.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m sixty-five years old and I live in one of the prettiest villages in the Cotswolds in a big, crazy old house full of what I call TREASURES and what my children call CRAP. We are probably ALL right. <br> <br>I have four children. Megan is forty, Bethan is thirty-eight and the twins, Rory and Rhys, are thirty-five. Oh, and thanks mainly to the frantic reproduction of my eldest daughter I am a multiple grandmother too! Do you have any children? You didn&#x2019;t mention them so I assume not? People usually tell you about their children before anything else, right? I don&#x2019;t see them very much, unfortunately, they&#x2019;re all so busy, and I&#x2019;m, well, I suppose you could say insular these days. I lost my partner about four years ago and things kind of unraveled from there, you might say.<br> <br>Anyway, what can I tell you about me? I love nature, I love the countryside, I love children, I love to swim. I&#x2019;m fit, for my age. I&#x2019;ve kept my figure over the years, and am grateful for that. I see some women I&#x2019;ve known for many years just turn to woolly mammoths once they pass menopause! And, as you can see from my picture, I&#x2019;ve kept my hair long. Nothing ages a woman faster than a haircut!!<br> <br>Anyway, that&#x2019;s enough about me. Tell me more about you! You say you&#x2019;re a widower. I&#x2019;m very sorry to hear that. And whereabouts in the North do you live? I can see from your photo that you have a dog. That is a very beautiful retriever. What is it called? We had a dog when the children were growing up, but once they&#x2019;d all gone, I could never quite see the point of animals.<br> <br>I will see what I can do about photographs. I&#x2019;m not really very techy beyond my laptop. But there must be something else I can send you. I&#x2019;ll check it out.<br> <br>Well, thank you, Jim, for getting in touch. The Internet really is a marvelous thing, especially for old codgers like us, wouldn&#x2019;t you say? I&#x2019;d be lost without it really. I&#x2019;d love to hear back from you again, but please don&#x2019;t feel you have to, if you think I sound dreadful!!<br> <br>Yours with best wishes,<br> <br>Lorelei Bird<br> <br>April 2011<br> <br>The damp heat came as a shock after the chill of the air-�conditioning that had cooled the car for the last two hours. Meg slammed the door behind her, pushed up the sleeves of her cotton top, pulled down her sunglasses and stared at the house.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br> <br>Molly joined her on the pavement, and gawped from behind lime-green Ray-Bans. &#x201c;Oh, my God.&#x201d;<br> <br>They stood together for a moment, side by side, the same height as each other now. Molly had caught up last summer, much to her delight. They now both stood at five foot eight. Molly long and lean as a fashion drawing, tanned legs in denim hot pants, honey-dusted hair bundled on top of her head in an artful pile, white Havaianas, a chambray shirt over a pink tank top, tiny ankles and wrists layered in friendship circlets and rubber bands. Meg, on the other hand, solid as a quarterback, sensible in three-quarter-length navy chinos and a Breton-�striped long-sleeved top, a pair of silver-sequined FitFlops and a last-minute pedicure her only concession to the unseasonal heat wave. Mother and only daughter, in the late stages of a nightmarish, clich�d teenage disaster that had lasted more than three years. Almost friends now. Almost. Someone had once told Meg that you get your daughter back when she&#x2019;s nineteen. Only four more years to wait.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is worse than I thought. I mean, so much worse.&#x201d; Meg shook her head and took a tentative step towards the house. There it stood, brick for brick, exactly as it had been the day she was born, forty years earlier. Three low windows facing out onto the street; four windows above; two front doors, one at either end; on the right by the side entrance a plaque, made by a long-dead local craftsman, an oval with the words The Bird House painted on it and a pair of lovebirds with their beaks entwined. The green-painted gate to the left of the house that opened up onto a graveled path to the back door, the stickers in the windows declaring membership of Neighborhood Watch (whatever happened to Neighborhood Watch? Meg wondered idly), allegiance to the RSPB and an intolerance towards people selling door-to-door.<br> <br>All there, just as it had been forever and ever.<br> <br>Except&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the worst house I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201d; said Molly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s worse than the ones on the TV shows.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t even been inside yet, Moll, hold that thought.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And my nose too, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, probably.&#x201d; She sighed.<br> <br>The windows, which to her recollection had never been cleaned, were now so thick with grime that they were fully opaque. In fact, they were black. The pastel-yellow Gloucester brick was discolored and damaged. The green gate was hanging off its post by one solitary nail and the graveled pathway was piled high with random objects: two old pushchairs, a rusty bike, a dead Christmas tree in a broken pot, a box of magazines swollen and waterlogged to twice their original size.<br> <br>The flat-fronted style of the house meant that it held most of its personality within and behind, but even on such scant display, it was clear that this house had a disease. The village had grown more and more gentrified over the decades, all the old houses scrubbed to a gleaming yellow, doors and window frames Farrow-&amp;-Balled to the nth degree, and there, lodged between them, like a rotten tooth, sat the Bird House.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, it&#x2019;s so embarrassing,&#x201d; said Molly, pushing her Ray-Bans into her hair and wrinkling her tiny nose. &#x201c;What must everyone think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say that judging by our local reputation this is probably no more than anyone in the village would expect. Come on then&#x201d;&#x2014;she smiled at her daughter, nervously&#x2014;&#x201c;let&#x2019;s go in, shall we? Get it over with?&#x201d;<br> <br>Molly smiled back grimly and nodded.<br> <br>April 1981<br> <br>Megan pulled back the ivy and pushed her fingertips inside a small crevice in the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got another one!&#x201d; she shouted out to Bethan and the twins.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, well done, Meggy!&#x201d; her mother called from the back step, where she stood in her strawberry-print apron watching proceedings with a contented smile. &#x201c;Bravo!&#x201d;<br> <br>Megan pulled out the small foil-wrapped egg and dropped it into her basket. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pink!&#x201d; she said pointedly to her younger sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; said Bethan. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got three pink ones already.&#x201d;<br> <br>Megan looked up at the sky; it was cloudless, densely blue, hot as July. Mum had said they needed to find their eggs quickly, otherwise they might melt. Her eyes scanned the gardens. She&#x2019;d found all the eggs in the woodpile, gingerly plucking them from next to rubbery woodlice. There&#x2019;d been more in the beds of daffodils and hyacinths that lined the pathways around the greenhouse and she&#x2019;d come across a big gold one sitting in the branches of the cherry tree outside the kitchen door. She counted up her eggs and found she had twelve. Bethan and the twins were still searching close to the house, but Megan suspected that the top garden had been all but stripped of its eggy assets, so she skipped down the slate-covered steps to the lower garden. Suddenly the sounds of her siblings and her mother faded to a murmur. It was warmer down here, soft and hazy. The grass had stripes in it, from where Dad had mown it yesterday, this way and that, and little piles of shaggy grass trimmings already turning pale in the burning sun. A camellia bush, confused by the early summer, had already bloomed and spilled its fat blossoms onto the lawn, where they lay browning and sated, halfway to ugly. Megan headed to the lichen-spotted sundial in the middle of the lawn. Three more foil-wrapped eggs sat on top of it and she brushed them into her basket with the side of her hand.<br> <br>She heard Bethan tripping down the steps behind her in her flamenco shoes. Megan turned and smiled. Sometimes when she looked at her little sister she felt overcome with love. Her worst enemy and her best friend.<br> <br>Meg and Beth looked identical. They both had what her mother called the &#x201c;Bird face.&#x201d; It was the same as her dad&#x2019;s and the same as her auntie Lorna&#x2019;s and the same as Granny Bird&#x2019;s. Apple cheeks, high foreheads, wide smiles. The only difference was that Megan&#x2019;s hair was brown and curly like Mum&#x2019;s, and Bethan&#x2019;s was straight and black like Dad&#x2019;s. Rory and Rhys, the twins, looked like their mum. They had &#x201c;Douglas faces.&#x201d; Low foreheads, long noses, neat bee-stung lips, and narrow blue eyes peering curiously from behind curtains of long blond hair.<br> <br>People always said, &#x201c;Oh, such lovely-looking children.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;You must be so proud, Mrs. Bird.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;What perfect angels.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Mum would say, &#x201c;You should see them when they&#x2019;re at home,&#x201d; and roll her eyes, with one hand running through �Rory&#x2019;s hair, the other wrapped around Rhys&#x2019;s hand and her voice full of love.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many have you got?&#x201d; Meg called out to her sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eleven. How about you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fifteen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their mother appeared at the bottom of the steps with the twins in tow. &#x201c;The boys have got nine each, I think we&#x2019;re almost there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Think yellow,&#x201d; she added with an exaggerated wink. The boys let go of her hands and ran towards the slide at the bottom of the garden that had yellow handles. Bethan ran towards an upturned bucket that was actually orange. But Megan knew exactly where her mother meant. The Saint-John&#x2019;s-wort bush right in front of them. She walked towards it and let her eyes roam over the clouds of yellow flowers abuzz with fat bumblebees before they came to rest on a row of terra-cotta pots underneath, overflowing with eggs and small yellow puffball chicks with glued-on eyes. She was about to scoop up the eggs and chicks when her mother touched her on her shoulder, her soft dry hands firm against Meg&#x2019;s sun-freckled skin. &#x201c;Share them,&#x201d; she whispered softly, &#x201c;with the little ones. Make it fair.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meg was about to complain but then she took a deep breath and nodded. &#x201c;Here!&#x201d; she called out to her siblings. &#x201c;Look! There&#x2019;s millions.&#x201d;<br> <br>All three hurtled to the Saint-John&#x2019;s-wort bush and their mother divided up the remaining eggs into four piles and handed them to each child in turn. &#x201c;Already starting to melt,&#x201d; she said, licking some chocolate from the edge of her thumb, &#x201c;better get them indoors.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cool of the house was shocking after the heat outside. It draped itself over Meg&#x2019;s bare skin like a cold flannel. Dad was pouring juice into beakers at the kitchen table. The dog was dozing on the window seat. The yellow walls of the kitchen were entirely covered over with the children&#x2019;s art. Megan ran her finger along the edges of a drawing that she&#x2019;d done when she was four. It always amazed her to think it had been stuck to the wall there, in the very same place, with the very same piece of Sellotape, for six whole years. She could barely remember being four. She certainly could not remember sitting and drawing this portrait entitled megn and mumy, composed of two string-legged people with crazy hair, split-in-half smiles and hands twice the size of their bodies, suspended in a gravity-free world of spiky blue trees and floating animals. The wall of art was a conversation piece for anyone coming into the house; it spanned all three walls, spread itself over cupboard doors, over door frames, around corners and even into the pantry. Dad would try and take some down occasionally, to &#x201c;update the wall&#x201d; as he&#x2019;d put it. But Mum would just smile her naughty-little-girl smile and say, &#x201c;Over my dead body.&#x201d; If Dad ever saw one of his children producing a piece of art he&#x2019;d snatch it away the moment it was shown to him and say, &#x201c;That is so very beautiful that I shall have to put it in my special folder,&#x201d; and spirit it away somewhere (occasionally tucked inside his clothes) before Mum saw it and stuck it to the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she said, pulling her tangly hair back into a ponytail and removing her apron, &#x201c;you can eat all the eggs you like as long as you promise you&#x2019;ll still have room for lunch. And remember, keep the foils for the craft box!&#x201d;<br> <br>The &#x201c;craft box&#x201d; was another bugbear of Dad&#x2019;s. It had once been a small plastic toolbox neatly filled with sequins and pipe cleaners and sheets of gold leaf. Over the years it had expanded into an ever-growing family of giant plastic crates that lived in a big cupboard in the hall, filled with an impossible tangle of old string lengths, knots of wool, empty sweet wrappers, toilet-roll middles, old underwear cut into rags, packing chips and used wrapping paper. Megan didn&#x2019;t really do crafts anymore&#x2014;she was nearly eleven now&#x2014;and Bethan had never been as creative as her sister, while the boys of course would rather be roaming the gardens or charging about the house than sitting with a tube of Pritt and a handful of old ice-lolly sticks. No one really used the craft box anymore, but that didn&#x2019;t stop Lorelei constantly topping it up with all sorts of old junk.<br> <br>She pulled the egg foils eagerly from the children now as they discarded them, smoothing them flat with her fingertips into delicate slivers, her face shining with satisfaction. &#x201c;So pretty,&#x201d; she said, piling them together, &#x201c;like little slices of rainbow. And of course, they will always make me think of today. This perfect day with my lovely children when the sun shone and shone and all was right with the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked at each child in turn and smiled her smile. She ran a hand over Rhys&#x2019;s hair and stroked it from his eyes. &#x201c;My lovely children,&#x201d; she said again, her words encompassing all four of them, but her loving gaze fixed firmly upon her last-born child.<br> <br>Rhys had been the smallest of all of Lorelei&#x2019;s babies. Megan and Bethan had both weighed over nine pounds. Rory had been the first twin out, weighing in at a healthy six pounds and fifteen ounces. And then, as her mother often recounted, out popped poor Rhys like a plucked quail, a little under four pounds, blue and wrinkled and just about able to breathe on his own. They&#x2019;d put him under lights&#x2014;or &#x201c;lightly toasted him,&#x201d; as Lorelei also often recounted&#x2014;and declared him fit to go home only after three long days.<br> <br>Lorelei still worried about him more than the other three. At just six years old he was smaller than Rory, smaller than most of the children in his class, with a pale complexion and a tendency to catch colds and tummy bugs. He clung to his mother whenever they were out in public, wailed like a baby when he got hurt and, unlike his brother, didn&#x2019;t like playing with other children. He seemed happy only when he was here, at home, brother on one side, mother on the other. Megan didn&#x2019;t know what to make of him. Sometimes she wished he&#x2019;d never been born. Sometimes she really thought they&#x2019;d be better off without him. He didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;match.&#x201d; All the Birds were fun and gregarious, silly and bright.

Kumihimo refers to all kinds of braiding; here, the focus is on Takadai, a term for colorful and elaborate single- and double-layered flat braids made on a high-stand frame, with a plain weave and twill structure. With more than 150 photographs, 70 charts, 25 illustrations, and easy-to-follow instructions, this collection offers an ideal introduction for anyone from weavers to embroiderers. Find out about the equipment, materials, and techniques; create color, weave, rep-weave, chevron, and textured patterns, plus braids with decorative edges; and make many designs to turn into scarves, bracelets, and other adornments. <i>A Selection of the Crafters Choice Book Club.</i><br></p><p>Rodrick Owen is a world-respected textile artist and teacher with over thirty years&#39; experience. As a commissioned artist his clients include the likes of Paul McCartney; his designs have been published in numerous magazines and exhibited worldwide. He specializes in traditional forms of braid making and in 1984 was awarded a Winston Churchill Fellowship to study Kumihimo in Japan, where he was also invited to teach at universities in Tokyo and Osaka.</p><h2>Grave Images: San Luis Valley: San Luis Valley</h2><p>Beginning in 1994, award-winning photographer and installation artist Kathy T.Hettinga began a fourteen-year project to document an unknown body of funerary folk art displayed in the cemeteries of rural and largely Hispanic communities in the San Luis Valley in southern Colorado. Her photographs of unique grave markers made of wood, concrete, metal, sandstone, glass, and other materials by individuals or families to commemorate the passing of loved ones capture the ethereal beauty of the cemeteries and serve as a touchstone for our common understanding of loss, grief, and the need to memorialize and pay tribute.</p><p><p><strong>Kathy T. Hettinga</strong> is a distinguished professor of art at the School of the Arts at Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. Her work has been displayed in numerous regional, national, and international exhibitions, and her artist's books and computer prints are in the permanent collections of the Grunewald Center for Graphic Arts (UCLA), the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the New York Public Library, and Yale University Library. Her essays and images have been published in numerous anthologies. </p>&#34;A poignant, elegiac meditation on the material culture of death and remembrance.&#34; -- David Morgan</p><h2>Return of the Squirtle Squad (Pokemon Chapter Book)</h2><p>Ash recalls how he met his Squirtle, the leader of the Squirtle Squad--a group of practical jokers--how Squirtle helped him in becoming a Pok�emon master, and how it helped free the Squirtles&#39; home from danger.</p><p></p><h2>I&#39;ll Be You and You Be Me</h2><p>Poems deal with friendship, patience, dreams, brothers and sisters, love, growing up, holidays, and animals</p><p>From the creators of <i>A Hole Is to Dig</i> comes a reissue of another classic, <i>I'll Be You and You Be Me</i>. Author Ruth Krauss and illustrator Maurice Sendak, with a little help from some young friends, capture all the ups and downs of friendship. A charmingly meandering series of stories, poems, and pen-and-ink line drawings feels like a scrapbook of kid-speak: <blockquote> --He runs <br> --I run <br> --He jumps <br> --I jump <br> --He dunks his toast <br> and I dunk mine <br> </blockquote> Short-short plays, mysteries, and fairy tales are sprinkled with Sendak's (<i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, etc.) tiny, sketchy images. Open to any page and dive right in! (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Ruth Krauss, a member of the experimental Writer&#39;s Laboratory at the Bank Street School in New York City in the 1940s, imaginatively used humor and invented words to create some of the very first books for children that highlighted the child s inner life. She collaborated with some of the greatest illustrators in children s literature, including her husband, Crockett Johnson.</p><h2>Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans</h2><p><p> The Nabataean Arabs, one of the most gifted peoples of the ancient world, are today known only for their hauntingly beautiful rock-carved capital--Petra. Here, in the wild and majestic landscapes of southern Jordan, they created some of the most prodigious works of man in the vast monuments that they chiseled from the sandstone mountains. The very scale of their achievement is breathtaking, but beyond mere magnitude is their creative vision, for they transformed the living rock of Petra into an enduring architectural masterpiece. </p><p> For nearly two thousand years, their civilization has been lost and all but forgotten. Yet the Nabataeans were famous in their day--Herod the Great and his sons, and a kaleidoscope of Roman emperors, were keenly aware of their power and wealth. Often victims of Greek, Roman, or Herodian duplicity, murder, and power politics, the Nabataeans were major players in the drama of the Middle East in biblical times. </p><p> This richly illustrated volume recounts the story of a remarkable but lost civilization and the capacity of its people to diversify their skills as necessity demanded. It describes their nomadic origins, the development of their multifaceted culture, their relations with their now famous neighbors, and the demise of their kingdom. It looks at their continued, if unrecognized, survival as Christians and farmers under the Byzantine Empire and into the early years of Islam. </p></p><p><b>Jane Taylor</b>, a writer and photographer, is the author of <i>High Above Jordan</i> and <i>Imperial Istanbul</i> and coauthor of <i>Testament to the Bushmen</i>.Writer and photographer Taylor has created a beautifully illustrated work covering the history of the Nabataeans, an Arab people who lived in the area of present-day southern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia from about the third century BCE until the sixth century CE...Taylor's clear, incisive writing and copious photographs bring the ancient world of the Nabataeans to life. Highly recommended. (Elizabeth Salt <i>Library Journal</i> 2002-08-01)<br><br>For anyone who wants to know more about Jordan's most admired landmark--basically, a narrow canyon chiseled into a kind of Middle Eastern Main Street, from its fancy fa�ades to its recessed rooms--or the people who created it, this book offers excellent photography. (Christopher Reynolds <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 2002-09-08)<br><br>This is an excellent book for the intelligent reader seeking an introduction to this field. The author, a writer and a photographer, has done a fine job, reflecting her love of the subject matter...The book, skillfully written, richly illustrated, and reasonably priced, will serve well its purpose to promote updated knowledge of a fascinating ancient Arab culture beyond the limited circle of professional scholars. The author and the publishers should be congratulated for this achievement. (Joseph Patrich <i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i> 2005-10-01)</p><h2>Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout: New Techniques, Tactics, and Patterns</h2><p>This first modern, all-encompassing manual on the art of streamer fishing teaches new techniques for catching trophy-sized trout on a fly. Streamers are the most effective of all fly patterns for the seduction of large trout, because they imitate the look and behavior of the smaller fish these trophies feed on. Sooner or later, every angler seeking the thrill of landing a trout over 20 inches--a dream fish for most--will need to understand the particular art of streamer fishing. This is the first book written about streamers in over 50 years. Despite streamer fishing&#39;s perennial popularity, it has been eclipsed in recent years by the sport&#39;s long love affair with dry flies. Revealed here in this indispensable, knowledgeable book are dozens of new streamer patterns and many proven advanced techniques for hooking huge trout, making it a must-buy for the dedicated fly-fisherman at any level of experience. Included in this guide: * New information on the feeding behavior of large trout and what it means for the angler * Detailed, illustrated casting and fishing techniques for a variety of conditions * Advice on netting and releasing trout safely, as well as photographing them * Color photographs of new and classic patterns, with complete tying recipes * Includes dozens of how-to illustrations</p><p>Bob Linsenman is the author of Great Lakes Steelhead, Michigan Trout Streams, and The Ausable River. He&#39;s been a dedicated fly-fisherman and guide for most of his life. He lives in Rose City, Michigan. Kelly Galloup owns The Troutsman, a fly-fishing shop and guide service, in his hometown of Traverse City, Michigan. He is a pioneer in developing flies and techniques for streamer fishing, a sport he has pursued for 25 years. Both authors have written articles for Fly Fisherman, The Fly Fisher, American Angler, Wild Steelhead and Salmon, and other publications."Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout" is fresh, clear, revolutionary, and probably a little dangerous. It will change the way you think. -- <i>Jerry Dennis, author of "The River Home"</i></p><h2>David Copperfield (Great Illustrated Classics) by Charles DIckens (2009-05-04)</h2><p>Growing Up! Young David Copperfield, orphaned as a child, abandoned by a vicious stepfather, must learn to make a life for himself. In Charles Dickens&#39; brilliant novel, we learn of David&#39;s early harsh years. . . his adoption by his eccentric aunt. . . his betrayal by a childhood friend. . . the pressures of starting a career. . . immature, young love. . . and finally career success and personal happiness. Charles Dickens&#39; sensitive portrayal of David&#39;s early years has made David Copperfield one of the world&#39;s most beloved novels.</p><p></p><h2>The White Trilogy</h2><p>In this book, a jagged, brilliant tour of London noir, Detective Chief Inspector Roberts and Detective Sergeant Brant are obverse sides of the same tarnished coin. They come up against some of the worst thugs, gangs, and lowlifes.</p><p>Ken Bruen, in addition to writing several of the most acclaimed British crime novels of the past decade, has a varied past that includes stints teaching in Africa and Vietnam, four months in a South American prison, a brief period as a security guard at the World Trade Center, and work as an actor for horror film director Roger Corman. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and divides his time between Galway, Ireland, and South London. He is the author of eleven books, including London Boulevard, The Guards, The Killing of the Tinkers, The Hackman Blues and Shades of Grace.Hip, violent and funny vignettes of the mean streets of southeast London tie together this rowdy set of short novels by Bruen (The Guards), a modern Irish master of the hard-boiled. Collecting A White Arrest (1998), Taming the Alien (1999) and The McDead (2000) for first U.S. publication, this omnibus showcases the investigations of the aging Chief Inspector Roberts and the brutish Detective Sergeant Brant, with the assistance of the unlucky-in-love Woman Police Constable Falls. They don't always solve their assigned crimes, but know perfectly well if they can nail the occasional major criminal-"the white arrest"-they'll be able to keep their jobs. Among numerous subplots, they pursue a serial killer stalking England's winning soccer team, a vigilante gang hanging drug dealers and a hit man known as "The Alien" because he whacked a victim engrossed in the video of that movie with a baseball bat just as the monster pops out of John Hurt's chest. But quieter moments, such as Brant's visit to his home county in Ireland, are just as interesting. Bruen's relentless media references (to pop songs, noir movies, other crime novels, even H.P. Lovecraft and Jack Kerouac) may drive some readers to distraction, and his loose, ironic endings no doubt are too postmodern for traditional tastes. This is fun reading, though, for readers seeking something fresh.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Soul at Rest</h2><p>This practical devotional offers fresh insight into little understood aspects of prayer and introduces a step-by-step journey of learning contemplative prayer.</p><p>I am excited to share that I have updated and revised this book, adding a small, group guide.&nbsp; New version release date: November 6, 2018.&nbsp; New subtitle: The Soul at Rest: A Forty-Day Journey into a Life of Prayer.FINDING ENDURING REST AND PEACE IN GOD<p>Many Christians today are discovering another side of prayer.

Collects <i>Raven: Daughter of Darkness</i> #1-6.</p><p>One of the most prolific and influential writers in modern comics, Marv Wolfman began his career as an artist. Realizing that his talents lay more in writing the stories than in drawing them, Wolfman soon became known for his carefully crafted, character-driven tales. In a career that has spanned nearly 30 years, Wolfman has helped shape the heroic careers of DC Comics' Green Lantern, Blackhawk and the original Teen Titans, as well as Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and Nova. In addition to co-creating <i>The New Teen Titans</i> and the universe-shattering <i>Crisis On Infinite Earths </i>with George P�rez, Wolfman was instrumental in the revamp of Superman after <i>Crisis</i>, the development of <i>The New Teen Titans</i> spinoff series <i>Vigilante, Deathstroke The Terminator </i>and Team Titans, and created such characters as Blade for Marvel, along with <i>Night Force</i> and the retooled <i>Dial "H" For Hero</i> for DC. In addition to his numerous comic-book credits, Wolfman has also written several novels and worked in series television and animation, including the Superman cartoon of the late 1980s and currently the hit Teen Titans show on Cartoon Network.&#x201c;Wolfman is a legend amongst comic creators and there&#x2019;s a reason for that... His fantastic understanding of molding captivating tales can be seen in his latest Raven saga.&#x201d; &#x2014;Comicosity</p><h2>The Blotting Book</h2><p>The print of an incriminating letter in a blotting book threatens to seal the conviction of Morris Assheton for the murder of Godfrey Mills</p><p>Edward Frederic "E. F." Benson (24 July 1867 &#x2013; 29 February 1940) was an English novelist, biographer, memoirist, archaeologist and short story writer. E. F. Benson was born at Wellington College in Berkshire, the fifth child of the headmaster, Edward White Benson (later Chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, Bishop of Truro and Archbishop of Canterbury), and Mary Sidgwick Benson ("Minnie"). Benson was educated at Temple Grove School, then at Marlborough College, where he wrote some of his earliest works and upon which he based his novel David Blaize. He continued his education at King's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member of the Pitt Club, and later in life he became an honorary fellow of Magdalene College. Benson's first book was Sketches from Marlborough. He started his novel writing career with the (then) fashionably controversial Dodo (1893), which was an instant success, and followed it with a variety of satire and romantic and supernatural melodrama. He repeated the success of Dodo, which featured a scathing portrait of composer and militant suffragette Ethel Smyth (which she "gleefully acknowledged", according to actress Prunella Scales), with the same cast of characters a generation later: Dodo the Second (1914), "a unique chronicle of the pre-1914 Bright Young Things" and Dodo Wonders (1921), "a first-hand social history of the Great War in Mayfair and the Shires". The Mapp and Lucia series, written relatively late in his career, consists of six novels and two short stories. The novels are: Queen Lucia, Lucia in London, Miss Mapp (including the short story "The Male Impersonator"), Mapp and Lucia, Lucia's Progress (published as The Worshipful Lucia in the United States) and Trouble for Lucia. The short stories are "The Male Impersonator" and "Desirable Residences". Both appear in anthologies of Benson's short stories, and the former is also often appended to the end of the novel Miss Mapp.</p><h2>Gin Tama, Volume 1</h2><p>The samurai didn&#39;t stand a chance. First, the aliens invaded Japan. Next, they took all the jobs. And then they confiscated everyone&#39;s swords. So what does a hotheaded former samurai like Sakata &#34;Gin&#34; Gintoki do to make ends meet? Take any odd job that comes his way, even if it means losing his dignity.</p><p><b>Hideaki Sorachi was born on May 25, 1979 and grew up in Hokkaido, Japan. His ongoing series, GIN TAMA, became a huge hit when it began running in the pages of Japan's Weekly Shonen Jump in 2004. A GIN TAMA animated series followed soon after, premiering on Japanese TV in April 2006. Sorachi made his manga debut with the one-shot story DANDELION, which is included in volume 1 of the GIN TAMA graphic novels.<br></b>Talk about a high concept that's perfect for the Shonen Jump line of boy's adventure comics: samurais versus aliens. In this book, aliens invaded Edo-era Japan and outlawed the samurai way of life. Centuries later, Gin Tama is a renegade ronin, who does various odd jobs to help his friend Shin get his family dojo back in business. The chapters are actually much more character-based than one would expect from such a far-out idea. The theme of not letting traditions die in the face of changes in society is presented by Gin and Shin holding onto the samurai way while the rest of Edo gives way to alien decadence. Not only is there some food for thought in the book, the adventures can actually be pretty funny. Characters occasionally break the fourth wall. In the first chapter, when Shin asks why Gin held off attackers for only one page, Gin confesses that's still a lot for a manga artist to draw. Sorachi's characters are designed very appealingly, but his line work could be stronger. There are many times when characters would look much better developed, as a book with this much panache demands. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She has written for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>National Geographic</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and lives in New Hampshire. When Elizabeth Marshall Thomas first arrived in Africa to live among the Kalahari San, or bushmen, it was 1950, she was nineteen years old, and these last surviving hunter-gatherers were living as humans had lived for fifteen thousand centuries. Thomas wound up writing about their world in a seminal work, <i>The Harmless People </i>(1959), a book that is still in print.&nbsp;The history of mankind that most of us know is only the tip of the iceberg, a brief stint compared to fifteen thousand centuries of life as roving clans that seldom settled down adapted every day to changes in environment and&nbsp;food supply, and lived for the most part like the animal ancestors from which they evolved. Those origins are not so easily abandoned, Thomas suggests, and our wired, documented, and market-driven society has plenty to learn from&nbsp;the Bushmen of the Kalahari about human evolution.&nbsp;As she displayed in&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Life of Dogs</i>, Thomas&nbsp;helps us see the path that we have taken in our human journey. In <i>The Old Way</i>, she shows how the skills and customs of the hunter-gatherer share much in common with the survival tactics of our animal predecessors.

It would be a coming of age like no other, with stunning and unforeseen rewards for the field of Anthropology. Her mother, Lorne Marshall, would write<i> The !Kung of Nyae Nyae</i>, one of the great ethnographies of all time; her brother John made a series of films culminating (just before he died) in the epic<i> Kalahari Family</i>, chronicling the fate of the !Kung through early contacts and discovery of their remarkable way of life, to their tragic displacement from the lands that had sustained them for so many thousands of year. Elizabeth herself, an extraordinarily gifted writer went on to write a number of best-selling books. Now, half a century later, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas returns to those early experiences and re-examines what she learned from the people, places, animals and lifeways encountered in the Kalahari long ago. The result is a brilliantly conceived, wise and hauntingly vivid, portrait of the natural and social worlds inhabited by people living much as our earliest human ancestors must have. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas&#x2019; finest book to date,<i> The Old Way</i>, is a deeply felt, deeply observed masterpiece that<i> </i>transforms the way we look at our own world." <b>Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, author of<i> Mother Nature</i>: <i>A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural Selection</i></b>&nbsp;"This is the owner's manual we need for humankind. <i>The Old Way </i>gives us critical insight into our past at a turning point in human history by one of the few people who has seen our kind living as we have lived for most of our species' existence.

As she revisits their culture, she shows how the African natives have long known more about their world and been less superstitious than their "educated" counterparts. They don't need modern science to tell them how to eat a poisonous beetle without getting sick, for example. As a writer, Thomas is adept at using humor and keen observation to back up her points. As a narrator, though, her reading can be monotonous. THE OLD WAY is a fascinating book that is worth listening to, but it could use a livelier narration.

His novels include <i>The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Jurassic Park,</i> and <i>Timeline.</i> He is also the creator of the television series <i>ER.</i>A Harvard medical-school graduate, inveterate traveler and author of, among other books, The Great Train Robbery (the film version of which he directed), Crichton seeks in immediate experience of new places and cultures to "redefine" himself and uncover the nature of reality. His curiosity and self-deprecating humor animate recitals of adventures tracking animals in Malay jungles, climbing Kilimanjaro and Mayan pyramids in the Yucatan, trekking across a landslide in Pakistan, scuba diving in the Caribbean and New Guinea and amid sharks in Tahiti. This memoir includes essays on his medical training and forays into the psychic, including channeling and exorcism, that have led him to conclude that scientists and mystics share the same basic search for universal truth by different paths. 75,000 first printing; BOMC alternate; Franklin Library First Edition selection. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Agatha Christie: The Art of Her Crimes</h2><p>Beautiful full color collection of over 90 book cover paintings by Adams that he did for many of Christie's mysteries.

The <em>FAMILY MEETING!</em> sign is up in her house, and she just knows she's in trouble for something. Has she been too mean to her little brother? Too sloppy? Eating too much junk food? Try as she might to find out what's on the agenda, her parents won't reveal anything before the meeting. As far as Clementine is concerned, the agenda should be something like: "We're getting a gorilla." But no, it's something entirely different. "We're talking about a new baby," says her father. "A brother or sister for you two. What do you think about that?" NO THANKS! is what Clementine thinks. After all, <em>four</em> is the perfect number for a family. There are four sides to a table, not five. Will Clementine learn to make room for one more?<br> Readers will chuckle at Clementine's unique perspective on the age-old issue of sibling rivalry.</p><p>Sara Pennypacker (www.sarapennypacker.com) is the author of four previous Clementine books and <i>Sparrow Girl</i>, illustrated by Yoko Tanaka. She divides her time between Texas and Massachusetts. <br><br><br>Marla Frazee (www.marlafrazee.com) has illustrated all of the Clementine books and many other beloved titles. She has been awarded a Caldecott Honor on two occasions, for <em>All the World</em> by Liz Garton Scanlon, and for <i>A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever</i>, which she also wrote. She lives in Pasadena, California, where she works in a small backyard cabin under an avocado tree.Clementine has had many not-so-good days. But this one just might be the worst. She loses her favorite hat, her science project is ruined and the "family meeting!" sign is up on the refrigerator-that's never a good thing. Even though family meetings are supposed to be about family issues, Clementine usually ends up getting in trouble. But this one is different. Clementine's dad announces that their family is going to grow. Are they are getting a gorilla, like Clementine has always wanted?! No. It's a new baby. Clementine is N-O-T, not happy. They are a family of four. Four is a perfect number. In infallible Clementine reasoning: "Four can be two and two sometimes, and nobody is lonely. Two kids and two grown-ups. Two boys and two girls. There are four sides to the kitchen table, so we each get one." Five just doesn't work. Pennypacker tackles the oft-written new-baby theme from a refreshing, older perspective; jealousy is not the foremost emotion, it's vulnerability. Everything is changing too fast. Clementine and her dad have always had a unique bond, but in this venture, he especially shines. He picks up on unspoken feelings and knows just how to give the right amount of comfort. Filled with familiar Clementine charm but, more importantly, a whole lot of heart, too. Kirkus"<br><br>Something is always up with third-grader Clementine. Here, it's her worries about a family meeting and the disappearance of the rat she and her friend Waylon are using in a science experiment. The mystery of the family meeting is solved early on-there's a new baby on the way. Unraveling her feelings about this event takes up most of the book. The whereabouts of the rat is also resolved, though in a way some readers might see coming. This entry in the popular, ongoing series is once again illustrated by Frazee's delightful pictures. Booklist"<br><br>Clementine knows that a family meeting means trouble, and when her mother won't give her an advance peek at the agenda, Clementine is really worried. Is she smiling enough? Being nice to her brother? Using her best manners? Nothing can prepare our heroine for the bombshell her parents launch: there will be a new baby in the house. Clementine's reaction is less than enthusiastic. "Our family is four. There are four sides to a puzzle so we can all work on it at once Four is the perfect number for a family!" Clementine's friends are changing, too. Margaret has become a "makeup fiend," and Waylon, her science class buddy, is suddenly obsessed with his self-professed superpowers. Even Eighteen, the rat who was supposed to be the star of their science project, has run away. Clementine's father reassures her by admitting that he understands her ambivalence about the new baby. And when Clementine calls a family meeting of her own, readers will see how much she has matured in just a few years and can imagine what a great big sister she will make. Clementine is becoming a more complex character as she matures, and fans of this fine series will enjoy the nuanced way she has grown more trustworthy and mature while staying true to herself. Horn Book"<br><br>Clementine's fifth adventure for early chapter-book readers addresses a topic many children can relate to. The third-grader's parents call a family meeting to announce that a new baby is on the way. Clementine's reaction to the news is realistic she says "No thanks!" She argues that four is the perfect number for a family, for reasons as varied as there are four sides to a puzzle to the fact that hot dogs come in packages of eight, so a family of four can have two each. Her parents are a little surprised by her reaction but take the time to try to understand how she is feeling and demonstrate how special she is to them. Through some humorous conversations with her friends, grandparents, and teacher, Clementine changes her perspective on the situation. This is a solid entry in the series, and it will surely keep readers wanting more.

It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives -- the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness -- are inextricable from the history playing out around them. <br> <br> Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made <i>The Kite Runner</i> a beloved classic, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heartwrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love -- a stunning accomplishment.</p><p>It's difficult to imagine a harder first act to follow than <i>The Kite Runner</i>: a debut novel by an unknown writer about a country many readers knew little about that has gone on to have over four million copies in print worldwide. But when preview copies of Khaled Hosseini's second novel, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i>, started circulating at Amazon.com, readers reacted with a unanimous enthusiasm that few of us could remember seeing before. As special as <i>The Kite Runner</i> was, those readers said, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is more so, bringing Hosseini's compassionate storytelling and his sense of personal and national tragedy to a tale of two women that is weighted equally with despair and grave hope. <p> We wanted to spread the word on the book as widely, and as soon, as we could.

This is a brilliant writer and I look forward to more of his work." <i>Read Joanna Daneman's review</i><br><br> <b>Seth J. Frantzman</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has done it again with 'A Thousand Splendid Sons', presenting a new, dashing and dark tale of two generations of women trapped in a loveless marriage, bracketed by great events." <i>Read Seth J. Frantzman's review</i><br><br> <b>Donald Mitchell</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has succeeded in capturing many important historical and contemporary themes in a way that will make your heart ache again and again. Why will your reaction be so strong? It&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ll identify closely with the suffering of almost all the characters, a reaction that&#x2019;s very rare to a modern novel." <i>Read Donald Mitchell's review</i><br><br> <b>Lawrance M. Bernabo</b>: "All things considered, following up on a successful first novel is probably harder than coming up with the original effort and Hosseini could have rested on his laurels in the manner of Harper Lee, but as "A Thousand Splendid Suns" amply proves, this native of Kabul has more stories to tell about the land of Afghanistan." <i>Read Lawrance M. Bernabo's review</i><br><br> <b>Amanda Richards</b>: "There are parts of this book that will have grown men surreptitiously blotting the tears that are on the verge of overflowing their ducts, and by the time you get to the middle, you won&#x2019;t be able to put it down. Hosseini's simple but richly descriptive prose makes for an engrossing read, and in my opinion, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is among the best I have ever read. This is definitely not one to be missed." <i>Read Amanda Richards's review</i><br><br> <b>N. Durham</b>: "All that being said, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a bit more enjoyable than Hosseini&#x2019;s previous "The Kite Runner", and once again he manages to give we readers another glimpse of a world that we know little about but frequently condemn and discard. However, if you were one of the many that for some reason absolutely loved "The Kite Runner", chances are that you'll love this as well." <i>Read N. Durham's review</i><br><br> <b>John Kwok</b>: "Khaled Hosseini's "A Thousand Splendid Suns" is a genuine instant literary classic, and one destined to be remembered as one of 2007's best novels. It should be compared favorably to such legendary Russian novels like "War and Peace" and "Doctor Zhivago"." <i>Read John Kwok's review</i><br><br> <b>Thomas Duff</b>: "Normally I'm more of an action-adventure type reader when it comes to novels and recreational reading. But I was given the chance to read A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini (author of The Kite Runner), so I decided to try something out of my normal genre. I am *so* glad I did. This is a stunning and moving novel of life and love in Afghanistan over a 30 year period." <i>Read Thomas Duff's review</i><br><br> <b>Charles Ashbacher</b>: "This book manages to simultaneously capture the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years and how women are treated in conservative Islamic societies.... In many ways it is a sad book, your heart goes out to these two women in their hopeless struggle to have a decent life with a brutal man in an unforgiving, intolerant society." <i>Read Charles Ashbacher's review</i><br><br> <b>W. Boudville</b>: "Hosseini presents a piognant view into the recent tortured decades of the Afghan experience. From the 1970s, under a king, to the Soviet takeover, to the years of resistance. And then the rise and fall of the Taliban. An American reader will recognise many of the main political events. But to many Americans, Afghanistan and its peoples and religion remain an opaque and troubling mystery." <i>Read W. Boudville's review</i><br><br> <b>Mark Baker</b>: "I tend to read plot heavy books, so this character study was a definite change of pace for me. I found the first half slow going at times, mainly because I knew where the story was going. Once I got into the second half, things really picked up. The ending was very bittersweet. I couldn't think of a better way to end it." <i>Read Mark Baker's review</i><br><br> <b>Grady Harp</b>: "Hosseini takes us behind those walls for forty some years of Afghanistan's bloody history and while he does not spare us any of the descriptions of the terror that continues to besiege that country, he does offer us a story that speaks so tenderly about the fragile beauty of love and devotion and lasting impression people make on people." <i>Read Grady Harp's review</i><br><br> <b>Robert P. Beveridge</b>: "When I was actively reading it, the pages kept turning, and more than once I found myself foregoing food or sleep temporarily to get in just one more chapter. When I had put it down, however, I felt no particular compulsion to pick it back up again. It's a good book, and a relatively well-written one, but it's not a great book. Enjoyable without leaving a lasting impression." <i>Read Robert P. Beveridge's review</i><br><br> <b>B. Marold</b>: "While the events in Afghanistan and the wider world create a familiar framework for the stories of these two women, it is nothing more than a framework. The warp and weft of everyday life, and the interaction of the two women and their close relatives is the heartbeat of the story." <i>Read B. Marold's review</i><br><br> <b>Daniel Jolley</b>: "Khaled Hosseini has written a majestic, sweeping, emotionally powerful story that provides the reader with a most telling window into Afghan society over the past thirty-odd years. It's also a moving story of friendship and sacrifice, giving Western readers a rare glimpse into the suffering and mistreatment of Afghan women that began long before the Taliban came to power." <i>Read Daniel Jolley's review</i><br><br> </p><b>Khaled Hosseini</b> was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and moved to the United States in 1980.

And with good reason. Through genealogy, you can go back into history to meet people who have had more influence on your life than any others -- your ancestors.

He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Terry, and their three children.<i>Chapter One<br>Welcome to Me<br></i><br>November 29, 1955. Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Mount Sinai Hospital. Howard Michael Mandel was born to Albert and Evelyn Mandel. I have absolutely no recollection of my infancy, but I'm told I was the happiest, most idyllic child, not to mention the cleanest child known to man.<br><br>As excited as my mother must have been about having me, she tells me that she felt like a child herself. She was just twenty-three, and my father was twenty-nine. She was really nervous about her baby boy and wanted to protect him from the evils of the world at that time-the Commies, nuclear proliferation, and, most important, the invasion of germs.<br><br>Whenever somebody came over to see her baby, God forbid they should touch little Howard's teeny fingers. As soon as they left, she would take me into the bathroom and scrub my hands with soap and water. If somebody sniffled and touched my crib, my mother would mark the spot in her mind. She would remember that it was two inches to the left of the headboard, and again, as soon as that person left the room, she would hit that spot with the Lysol, putting me back in my sterile environment.<br><br>You might think this was over the top, but the apple didn't fall far from the tree. The first and all recollections I have of visiting my grandparents on my mother's side were of approaching the house and seeing my "bubbie" outside the front door on her hands and knees, waxing the concrete veranda. Waxing. Concrete. Outside. There was no way she was going to allow anyone to track filth into her home. She believed that this was the first line of defense toward maintaining a safe environment-that is, if you ignored the fact that it was very easy to slip and break your neck before you rang the doorbell. Let's weigh the odds here: no dirt on your feet, or a broken neck. She seemed to lean in favor of no dirt on the feet.<br><br>Once you were inside, not much changed. As in many homes in the Northeast and Midwest, inside the door there was a tray where you could remove your boots so you didn't track mud and snow into the house. I know there was a boot tray, but my grandmother's was covered in newspaper, because God forbid the boots should touch the tray. In fact, I don't think I ever touched any of the furniture or carpets in her house because it was all covered with plastic. Everything was hermetically sealed in its place.<br><br>So when I now see a picture of me as an infant, posed on a chair in my living room and separated from that chair by a sheet of plastic, it seems to make some sense.<br><br>I started my life with the cleanest of slates, so to speak. Everything went swimmingly well for Howard for those first two and a half years in what was metaphorically a perfectly chlorinated pool. But then comes my first memory of infancy. I may not be accurately depicting the facts, but I promise you I'm accurately depicting my memory.<br><br>In the last week of October 1957, my mother disappeared. My dad went off to work during the day, driving a cab, and a strange woman showed up at the house to take care of me.<br><br>I think her name was Mrs. Weatherburn. I can't remember her name as accurately as I can remember the fact that she wore dentures. I didn't know what dentures were at the time, which made things worse. In addition to being terrorized by the fact that my mother was gone, I had to deal with an old woman who would go into our bathroom in the morning, put her fingers in her mouth, rip out all her teeth in one piece, brush them in front of me, and then put them back into her face.<br><br>I felt as if I were living in a horror movie. You have no idea how scared I was. Every day after my father went to work, I was left alone with a lady who ripped out her teeth. All I wanted was my mommy. But Mommy had gone away. I felt like a small, human Jewish Bambi. In the span of seven days, I went from gleefully happy to utterly miserable.<br><br>At the end of the week, my dad informed me that we were going to pick up "the baby." I remember this as clearly as yesterday. I can tell you honestly I had no idea what "the baby" meant. He seemed excited about "the baby." He could have said we were picking up a lemur. It would have meant the same thing to me.<br><br>I want to clarify what "the baby" was. In the fifties, when women were pregnant and ready to give birth, they checked into the hospital for a week. At that time, children were not welcome as visitors in the maternity ward, which is why I didn't see my mother for a week. All this makes sense to me now, but it didn't then.<br><br>We drove to Mount Sinai Hospital in downtown Toronto. I hadn't been there in almost three years, and I didn't recognize the place. It was a cold, gray, drizzly day. We parked in the back of the building, and my dad disappeared inside to get "the baby."<br><br>I was sitting quietly in the car with Mrs. Weatherburn, waiting. I remember not saying anything for fear that she might talk to me and bare her teeth. I was afraid that those teeth might jump out at me at any moment. After what seemed like an eternity, my mother emerged through the hospital's big metal door.<br><br>I remember watching my mom, who was my whole life, coming out to the car. I was so excited to see her again. She was carrying something wrapped in blankets. This must be "the baby." My dad helped her into the backseat. Mommy leaned over, said, "I love you," and gave me a kiss.<br><br>As she leaned over, I looked inside all those blankets she was carrying and I could see a little face. There was another person with my mommy. Who was this? Was it "the baby"?<br><br>From that moment on, my life was different. My mom tells me that my whole demeanor changed. My sense of contentment was replaced with agitation.<br><br>Stevie-that's what they called "the baby"-needed very little attention. He had a couple of meals a day, a diaper change once in a while, and the rest of the time he slept. If you do the math, it worked out to about 5 percent of my mom's<br><br>attention. I received the other 95 percent. It wasn't even fifty- fifty between the two brothers, but I was completely distraught. Up until then, it had been me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. Now it was me, me, me, me, him, me, me, me. Can you understand how devastating this was for me?<br><br>Here are some of the ways I handled it. I would walk into the room where they kept little Stevie and scream as loud as I could to make him cry. Then my mom would come in and yell at me for waking up "the baby." But remember, she was yelling at me, so I had all the attention. One time he stuck his hand through the bars of his crib, and I pulled on it as hard as I could. He had to go to the hospital because I ripped his arm out of the socket. That was horrible, but again, I got a lot of attention for that.<br><br>I don't know how this is possible, but throughout our childhood, my brother always had-and continues to have-an amazing love for me. Whenever my mom got upset with me, she'd threaten: "That's it! Wednesday is garbage day. I'm throwing you out with the garbage." My brother would break into tears and plead, "Please don't throw Howie in the garbage." He was so scared that I would be tossed out and he wouldn't have me around. My punishments seemed to punish him more.<br><br>I now believe that my brother, Steve, is the reason I have become a performer today. From the moment "the baby" appeared, I spent every waking moment trying to get all the attention. Regardless of whether that attention was positive or negative, it was attention just the same. I didn't make the connection at the time, but child experts say that a good part of your personality and who you are going to be is formed in the first years of your life. If that is true, then the sick need that I have to be accepted and appreciated by people I don't know stemmed from spending my entire childhood trying to get 100 percent of the attention. Obviously, you can't get all the attention, but I promise you I'm still trying.<br><br>At age four, I was about to meet some other people vying for attention. I was enrolled in school. In the grade of kindergarten at Dublin Public School, to be exact. Looking back, I realize I didn't have a lot going for me. I was allergic to dairy products; I was suffering from seeping eczema and constant ear infections; and I was a bed wetter. And, oh, I forgot, a maniacal attention seeker.<br><br>I say bed wetter because I wet the bed, but wetting myself extended far beyond the bed. When I analyze this now-not that I or anyone was diagnosed at the time-I believe this wetting could have been a direct result of having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD for short. I have been professionally diagnosed with this disorder as an adult. The characteristics of this are an inability to focus, impulsive behavior, and being easily distracted. I have come to realize these symptoms have plagued me throughout my life. I remember thinking as a child, I have to go to the potty, and then I would see something shiny or hear a voice, and I would be off on a tangent. Soon, I would realize that my pants were wet, and I hadn't made it to the potty.<br><br>I don't want you to think I wasn't innovative. Here were the remedies to keep the other kids from realizing that Howard had just pissed himself: Through a varying array of excuses, I would dismiss myself quietly before anybody noticed the wet spot covering the front of my pants, find my way to a puddle or a ditch, and submerge myself. There were no puddles or ditches right out the front door, so I had to travel a far distance to trip and fall into a puddle. But this allowed me to hold my head up high and declare proudly to my classmates, "I've fallen into yet another puddle!" Throughout my early school years, I was known as the kid who would fall into a puddle or ditch six or seven times a year. In retrospect, this seems equally as embarrassing.<br><br>My kindergarten teachers were named Ms. Smith and Ms. Judge, and I was called by my full name, Howard. I'm Howie now because Howard makes me cringe. Howard comes mostly with the connotation of anger. There was never any good news afte...</p><h2>The Cottage Rules: An owner's guide to the rights &amp; responsibilities of sharing recreational property (Self-Counsel Reference)</h2><p>The Cottage Rules sets out no-nonsense, easy-to-use guidelines for cottage owners who share ownership with others.

What individual quality led Byron rightly to celebrate Nelson&#39;s genius as &#39;Britannia&#39;s God of War&#39;? Andrew Lambert demonstrates how Nelson elevated the business of naval warfare to the level of the sublime. Where his predecessors and opponents saw a particular battle as an end in itself, Nelson - even in the midst of terrifying, close-quarters action - was concerned to exploit the victory he was achieving. Nelson explores the professional, personal, intellectual and practical origins of the man&#39;s genius, to understand how the greatest warrior that Britain has ever produced transformed the art of conflict, and enabled his country to survive the challenge of total war and international isolation.</p><p>Professor Andrew Lambert is Professor of Naval History at King&#39;s College, London.

Feminist analysis and practice have recognized this. Feminist Christianity is reshaping religious institutions and religious life in more holistic, inclusive, and justice-focused ways."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>Feminism has brought many changes to Christian religious practice. From inclusive language and imagery about the Divine to an increase in the number of women ministers, Christian worship will never be the same. Yet, even now, there is a lack of substantive structural change in many churches and complacency within denominations.</p><p>The contributors to this book are the thought leaders who are shaping, and being shaped by, the emerging directions of feminist Christianity. They speak from across the denominational spectrum, and from the many diverse groups that make up the Christian community as it finds its place in a religiously pluralistic world. Taken together, their voices offer a starting point for building new models of religious life and worship.</p><p>Topics covered include feminist:</p><ul><li>Theological Visions</li><li>Scriptural Insights</li><li>Ethical Agendas</li><li>Liturgical and Artistic Frontiers</li><li>Ministerial Challenges</li></ul><p><strong>Contributors include:</strong></p><p>Mar�a Pilar Aquino � Rachel A.

There had been shattering explosions in the distance earlier, and one of them was covered with blood. Although they had been enemies, one of them now held the other's hand, as the lifeblood trickled from him. They looked at each other one last time, and then the injured man gave his last breath and died, just as there was the cracking sound of a gunshot nearby. The survivor of the pair looked wide-eyed and terrified as the man who had fired the gun appeared from behind them, seemingly out of nowhere, as though he had dropped from the sky like an avenging angel.<br><br>"Cut! . . . and print!" a voice rang out in the stillness, and within seconds, everything was action, a flock of men with cameras and equipment entered the scene, the dead man stood up as the blood ran down his neck, and a production assistant rushed up to him with a cold drink and he guzzled it gratefully. The man who had been holding his hand an instant before walked off the set to get something to eat as soon as he was told that they were finished shooting for the day.<br><br>Two dozen people were talking, shouting, and laughing, and a tall, thin blond woman in ragged cut-off denim shorts, high-top sneakers, and a torn man's undershirt conferred with the camera crew with an enormous grin on her face. Despite her fair coloring, she had a deep honey tan from being outdoors, and a mass of long, uncombed blond hair piled up on her head. A moment later, she braided it into a disheveled pigtail, and helped herself to a bottle of icy water as someone passed them out. There was an enormous catering truck nearby, and a still photographer shot the actors as they left the set. Four of Hollywood's biggest stars were in the film, which was always the case on her pictures. "It's going to be the best scene in the movie," the blond woman assured the head cameraman, as people came and went around them and checked with her, and the sound technician confirmed that he was happy with the scene too. Everything had gone smoothly. The Sand Man was going to be her best movie yet.<br><br>They were making her new film, sure to be an instant hit, like all the others Tallie Jones had made. Her films were box-office gold. She had been nominated for two Oscars and six Golden Globes. There were two Golden Globes on her desk, but no Oscars so far. And her pictures were an enormous success because she included both the kind of intense action men wanted in a film, just enough violence to suit their bloodlust without exploiting it excessively, and the sensitivity and emotional insights that made her films appealing to women. She offered the best of both worlds. Tallie had a Midas touch. At thirty-nine, she had been directing movies for seventeen years, and she hadn't made a lemon yet.<br><br>There was already a smell of victory on the set, and Tallie looked happy as she walked to the trailer that was her office on location with her dog-eared copy of the script under her arm. It included all the changes that the screenwriters had made the night before. Tallie was always honing and fine-tuning, she was a perfectionist, and people who worked with her accused her of micromanaging, but it was worth it. She turned her BlackBerry on as she walked into the air-conditioned trailer, and saw that she had two messages from her daughter, who was a freshman in college at NYU in New York, studying pre-law. Maxine, or Max as they called her, had no interest whatsoever in a career in films, only the law. She wanted to be a lawyer like her grandfather, Tallie's father, Sam Jones. He was Tallie and Max's hero, and they were the only two women in his life. Tallie's mother had died of leukemia when Tallie was in high school, and her father had been supportive of everything she did. Tallie had taken him to the Oscars with her as her escort, when she was nominated, and he was fiercely proud and protective of her.<br><br>It was Tallie's mother who had made her fall in love with movies. She had taken her to every imaginable movie as a child, watched every classic with her, and was fascinated with films and actors herself. She had named Tallie Tallulah, after Tallulah Bankhead, who she thought was the most glamorous woman who had ever lived. Tallie had always hated her name, and shortened it to something she could live with, but she had loved every film she'd ever seen with her mother, who had wanted desperately to be an actress, and wanted her daughter to fulfill her dreams. She hadn't lived to see Tallie's career or the wonderful films she made. Tallie always hoped her mother would have loved them and been proud of her. Tallie's mother had married her father at twenty-one, when he was already a successful lawyer at forty-five. It was his second marriage, but Tallie was his only child. He was eighty-five now, retired, and suffering from poor health. They called each other every day, and he loved hearing how it had gone on the set. She was his link to the outside world now, since he rarely got out anymore. Crippled with arthritis, it was just too hard.<br><br>Tallie's marital career had been a checkered one, not surprisingly in the world she lived in, where unstable relationships and quick turnover were the norm. She always said that it was impossible to meet normal, decent guys in the film industry. Max's father had been another story entirely. He was a cowboy from Montana she'd met at USC, and she'd gotten pregnant at twenty. She had dropped out of school for a year to have the baby, and her father had insisted they get married. They were both barely more than kids themselves, and by the time Max was six months old, her father had gone back to Montana, and they got divorced. Tallie had gone to see him a few times, to see if they could maintain the relationship, but their lives were totally different. Since then, he'd been on the rodeo circuit for twenty years, married a girl from Wyoming, and had three other kids. He sent Max a birthday card every year, a souvenir from the rodeo for Christmas, and Max had seen him four times in her life. He wasn't a bad guy, he just had no connection to Max, and came from another world. He'd been a handsome boy, stunningly so at twenty, and Max was even more beautiful than her mother, a six-foot-tall blonde, long and lanky with sky blue eyes. Tallie's eyes were green, and she was slightly shorter than her daughter. When they went out together, they made a striking pair, and looked more like sisters than mother and daughter.<br><br>Tallie's only other foray into marriage had been with an actor in one of her films. She never got involved with actors on the set of her movies, but had made an exception for him. He had been a major heartthrob, a big British star, and had swept her off her feet. She was thirty and he was twenty-eight, and he had cheated on her very publicly six months later when he was on location on another film. The marriage had lasted eleven months, they only spent three months of it together, and it had cost her a million dollars when she wanted out. He drove a hard bargain, and she paid the price.<br><br>She was alone for five years after that, and concentrated on her work and Max her daughter. She had no desire to try marriage again. And she'd been startled when she met Hunter Lloyd, a successful producer, and they started dating. There was nothing wrong with him, he wasn't a cheater, a liar, or a drunk. He'd had his own bad experiences with two failed marriages that had cost him a fortune too. They had started dating four years before, and lived together for the last three. He had moved in with her after a year, and had given up his own house, a palatial home in Bel Air, to his last wife. And for both of them, the arrangement worked. Tallie and Hunt loved each other, Max loved him too, and he was great to her.<br><br>Hunt was a big, kind teddy bear of a man, and the picture Tallie was making was the second one she had produced with him. The first one had been a record-breaking box-office hit. Together they were even more successful than either of them had been alone. And Tallie was happier than she'd been in years. She didn't want anything more than they had. Hunt Lloyd and the solid, quiet, stable relationship they shared were perfect for her. She was a modest person, despite her vast success, and liked leading a quiet life. She had no time to go out anyway, she was either shooting, preparing a film, or in post-production. There was rarely a time when she wasn't working.<br><br>At twenty-one, after she had Max, Tallie had been "discovered" by a Hollywood agent, in a supermarket. He had gotten her a screen test and into a film. She had only done it for the memory of her mother, and because she knew what it would have meant to her. She did fine, and the film did well, but she had hated every minute as an actress. It wasn't for her, nor anything that went with it. Much to her agent's annoyance, she turned down all the offers she got after that, and there had been several. The camera had loved her looks, and with some coaching she had been a decent actress, but what she had fallen in love with was directing. It was what she wanted to learn, and when she went back to college after having Max, she enrolled in USC's film school and applied herself. Her senior project had been a small low-budget film that she had made on a shoestring, financed with her father's help, and it had become a cult film, The Truth about Men and Women. It was the start of her career as a director. She had never stopped or looked back since.<br><br>Her first few movies did well and got rave reviews, and they started making big money by the time she was in her late twenties. She had become a Hollywood legend and a huge success in her seventeen years as a director. She loved what she did. What she didn't love, and never would, were all the trappings that went with it, the fame, the attention, the press, the premieres, all the opportunities to show off and be in the limelight. As far as she was concerned that was for actors, not for her, which was why she hadn't wanted to be an actress and loved being a director, and contributing to each actor's performance and interpretation of the script. After her one film as an actress, she could see what would happen to her if she pursued acting as a career, and she wanted none of it. Tallie was a worker, a creator, an artist. She was willing to work endlessly on everything she did, but not be a star. It was the one thing she didn't want, and she was very clear about it.<br><br>She'd had to go out and buy a dress when she went to her first Golden Globes when she was nominated; she didn't own one. All she had were the clothes she worked in, which made her look like a homeless person most of the time. Tallie didn't care. She was happy just the way she was, and Hunt loved her that way too. He was smoother and more worldly than she was, and more involved in the Hollywood scene, but it never went to his head, and he was always content to come home to Tallie, sprawled out on the floor or the couch, poring over scripts. And when she was on location, he joined her whenever he could. He was more of a businessman than someone involved in Hollywood. Pictures were big business to him, and it didn't get much bigger than a film produced with and directed by Tallie Jones. And whether she bothered to comb her hair or not was immaterial to him.<br><br>They were near Palm Springs, in the location they had set up. She had a hotel room there for when she wanted to spend the night, but most nights she tried to get back to her house in L.A. to be with Hunt, if she didn't have to work too late, or he came out to be with her.<br><br>Tallie wanted to look at some of the day's takes, particularly the last one, before she left the set for the day. She had three pencils and a pen stuck in her hair as she made notes and answered e-mails, and she was just leaving her trailer to go look at the day's rushes when a cloud of dust appeared on the road leading to the set, with a shiny silver Aston Martin causing it.<br><br>She squinted into the remaining sun as the sports car approached, spinning up a cloud of dust around it. The car came to a rapid halt near where Tallie stood, and she grinned as the driver got out. The woman emerging from the car was a spectacular-looking girl in a micromini skirt, with endless sexy legs, a striking figure, and a mane of blond hair. She looked rushed and windblown and like something in a movie as she climbed out of the car. She had an enormous turquoise bracelet on one wrist, diamond studs in her ears, and was wearing towering high heels.<br><br>"Shit, did I miss the last take of the day?" Brigitte, the beauty who owned the Aston Martin, looked annoyed, and Tallie grinned.<br><br>"It went great. You can watch the dailies with me. I was just going to look." Brigitte looked relieved.<br><br>"The traffic was unbelievable. I got stuck for half an hour twice." Brigitte looked every inch a star. In her platform stiletto sandals, she was taller than Tallie, her makeup was perfect, she never went out without it, and her outfit suited her to perfection, showed off her incredible body, and made her look irresistibly sexy. She was the opposite of Tallie in every way. Everything about her had been carefully thought out to catch the eye, as opposed to Tallie, who preferred to think of herself as invisible, and liked it that way. Her whole business was to show off others, not herself. Brigitte Parker loved the attention she got and had none of Tallie's subtlety and shyness. The two women had similar looks, both tall, thin, and blond, but did entirely different things with the attributes nature had given them. Tallie hid them, and Brigitte shone a spotlight on them. Tallie honestly didn't care how she looked and never thought about it. Brigitte put a lot of thought and effort into her dazzling appearance.</p><h2>City of Orphans</h2><p><b>Plot twists, big accusations, and plenty of shifty, crooked characters fill the pages of this harrowing adventure from Newbery Medalist Avi.</b><br><br>The streets of 1893 New York are crowded and filthy.

See what I&#x2019;m saying? It&#x2019;s all &#x2019;bout them words: &#x201c;luck,&#x201d; &#x201c;chance,&#x201d; &#x201c;coincidence,&#x201d; &#x201c;accident,&#x201d; &#x201c;quirk,&#x201d; &#x201c;miracle,&#x201d; plus a lot of words I&#x2019;m guessing I don&#x2019;t even know.<br> <br>But the thing is, I got a story that could use <i>all</i> them words. &#x2019;Bout a kid by the name of Maks Geless. That&#x2019;s Maks, with a <i>k</i>. M-a-k-s.<br> <br>Now, this Maks, he&#x2019;s regular height for a thirteen-year-old, ruddy-faced, shaggy brown hair, always wearing a cloth cap, canvas jacket, and trousers, plus decent boots. He&#x2019;s a newsboy&#x2014;what they call a &#x201c;newsie.&#x201d; So he&#x2019;s holding up a copy of the New York City newspaper <i>The World</i>,<i></i>and<i></i>he&#x2019;s<i></i>shouting, &#x201c;Extra! Extra! Read all &#x2019;bout it! &#x2018;Murder at the Waldorf. Terrible Struggle with a Crazy Man! Two Men Killed!&#x2019; Read it in <i>The World</i>! The world&#x2019;s greatest newspaper. Just two cents!&#x201d; <br> <br>Now, not everything gets into the papers, right? But see, the only one who knows what really happened up at the Waldorf is . . . Maks.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re thinking, how could this kid&#x2014;this newsie&#x2014;know?<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll tell you.<br> <br>This story starts on Monday, October 9, 1893. That&#x2019;s five days <i>before</i> the day of that headline you just heard. It&#x2019;s early evening, the night getting nippy. Electric streetlamps just starting to glow. In other words, the long workday is winking.<br> <br>Not for Maks. He&#x2019;s still on his regular corner, Hester Street and the Bowery. Been peddling <i>The World</i> for <i>five</i> hours and has sold thirty-nine papers. Sell one more and he&#x2019;ll have bailed his whole bundle. Do that and he&#x2019;ll have eighty cents in his pocket.<br> <br>Now listen hard, &#x2019;cause this is important.<br> <br>In 1893 newsies buy their papers and <i>then</i> sell &#x2019;em. So next day&#x2019;s bundle is gonna cost Maks seventy-two cents. <i>Then</i> he sells &#x2019;em for two cents each. Means, for his five hours&#x2019; work, he&#x2019;ll earn a whole eight cents. Not much, you say? Hey, these days, six cents buys you a can of pork and beans, enough eats for a day, which is more than some people gets.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re probably thinking, eight pennies&#x2014;that ain&#x2019;t hardly worth working all them hours. But this is 1893. These are hard times. Factories closing. Workers laid off. Not many jobs. Housing not easy to find. Fact, people are calling these days the &#x201c;Great Panic of 1893.&#x201d; And the thing is, Maks&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s rent is due <i>this</i> week. Fifteen bucks! For them, that&#x2019;s huge.<br> <br>All I&#x2019;m saying is, Maks&#x2019;s family needs him to earn his share, which is&#x2014;you guessed it&#x2014;eight cents a day.<br> <br>Now, most days when Maks finishes selling his papers, he likes staying in the neighborhood to see how his newsie pals have done. Don&#x2019;t forget, this is New York City. The Lower East Side. Something always happening.<br> <br>This night all Maks wants to do is to get home and eat. No surprise; he&#x2019;s hungry twenty-five hours a day, eight days a week. And last time he ate was breakfast&#x2014;a roll and a bowl of coffee-milk.<br> <br>So Maks holds up his last newspaper and gives it his best bark: &#x201c;Extra! Extra! Read all &#x2019;bout it! &#x2018;Joe Gorker, Political Boss, Accused of Stealing Millions from City! Trial Date Set! Others Arrested!&#x2019; Read it in <i>The World</i>!

Only two cents!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sure, sometimes crying headlines, Maks gets to head doodling that someday <i>he&#x2019;ll</i> be in the paper for doing something great, like maybe making a flying machine. So <i>The World</i> would pop <i>his</i> picture on its first page, like this here mug Joe Gorker. Then Maks reminds himself that his job is selling the news, not being it. Besides, <i>The World </i>is always laying down lines &#x2019;bout Joe Gorker, screaming that the guy is a grifter-grafter so crooked that he could pass for a pretzel.<br> <br>Anyway, Maks&#x2019;s shout works &#x2019;cause next moment, a fancy gent&#x2014;top hat, handlebar mustache, starched white collar, what some people call a &#x201c;swell stiff&#x201d;<i></i><i>&#x2014;</i><i></i>wags a finger at him.<br> <br>Maks runs over.<br> <br>The guy shows a nickel. &#x201c;Got change, kid?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, sir. No, sir.&#x201d; <br> <br>I know: Maks may be my hero, but he ain&#x2019;t no saint. Like I told you, for him, pennies are big. Needs all he can get.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; says the swell. &#x201c;Keep the change.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir!&#x201d; Maks says as he slings his last sheet to this guy.<br> <br>The guy walks off, reading the headlines.<br> <br>Maks, telling himself his day is done, pops the nickel into his pocket. Except no sooner does he do that than who does he see? <br> <br>He sees Bruno.<br> <br>This Bruno is one serious nasty fella. Taller than Maks by a head, his face is sprinkled with peach fuzz, greasy red hair flopping over his eyes, one of which is squinty, and on his head he&#x2019;s got a tipped-back brown derby, which makes his ears stick out like cute cauliflowers.<br> <br>But the thing is, Bruno may be only seventeen years old, but he&#x2019;s head of the Plug Ugly Gang.

Generations of children all over the world have grown up spending hours poring over his books filled with all the colorful details of their daily lives. No other illustrator has shown such a lively interest in the words and concepts of early childhood. For himself, whenever he was asked how old he was, Scarry would always put up one hand and laugh, saying, "five!" &nbsp; Born in 1919, Richard Scarry was raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his children's books. &nbsp; The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually Scarry created many original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic board book&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>.

In addition to providing realistic expectations for the hard work needed to regain everyday capabilities, Meyerson focuses on the less frequently documented emotional journey in recovery. Virtually every survivor is haunted by questions like: "Who am I now?" and "How do I rebuild a meaningful and rewarding life?" after losing so much of what they had before--capabilities, careers and jobs, relationships, and more. This is a book full of hope for survivors--from stroke or other injuries--as well as their families and support networks.<br><br>All author proceeds from this book will go to <b>Stroke-Forward.org</b>, a nonprofit initiative that will support stroke and other survivors, and advocate for a more human-centered approach to health care.<br><br><i>Identity Theft</i> centers on Debra's experience: her stroke, her extraordinary efforts to recover, and her journey to redefine herself. But she also draws on her skills as a social scientist, sharing stories from several dozen fellow survivors, family members, friends, colleagues, therapists, and doctors she has met and interviewed. By sharing this diversity of experiences, Debra highlights how every person is different, every stroke is different, and every recovery is different. She provides a valuable look at the broad possibilities for successfully navigating the challenging physical recovery--and the equally difficult emotional journey toward rebuilding one's identity and a rewarding life after a trauma like stroke.</p><p>Previously a tenured professor at Stanford University, <b>DEBRA MEYERSON </b>studied, wrote, lectured, and taught about diversity, gender, identity, and organizational change. In September 2010, Debra&#x2019;s life and career were derailed by a severe stroke that nearly killed her and initially left her paralyzed on the right side&#x2014;and completely mute. Years of intensive therapy and a relentless work ethic enabled Debra to regain her independence, but she still lives with physical limitations and speech challenges. Debra wrote <i>Identity Theft </i>to help other survivors and those closest to them navigate the emotional journey that she has found very difficult&#x2014;and rewarding. Debra lives in Menlo Park, California, with her husband, and has three grown children.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>DANNY ZUCKERMAN </b>is the cofounder of 3Box, a peer-to-peer social network that helps people create more meaningful connections and communities online.

But in a departure from the family-friendly programming produced by the last industry boom - the 1980s wave, which made household names of Hulk Hogan, 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper and Andre the Giant - the new era of wrestling combined stunning athleticism with a raunchy sex appeal, engrossing story lines and novel production techniques that reflected a changing society and its shifting values. </p><p>Once again, wrestling was a ubiquitous phenomenon - only this time, it seemed as though the fad would never end. With both WCW and WWF expanding into other forms of entertainment - movies, video games, music and the like - the potential for growth appeared to be limitless.</p><p>But with uncertainty surrounding its corporate future, and increasingly uninspired programming eroding its audience, WCW stood on the verge of collapse. Three years into a five-year plan devised by its charismatic leader - a former Blue Ribbon Foods salesman named Eric Bischoff - the company whose unexpected ascension initiated the entire boom was operating on borrowed time.</p><p>For by the end of the five-year plan, WCW ceased to exist.</p><p>But NITRO is a story about much more than WCW and the Monday Night Wars. It is a story of an era, a time in which the media and cultural landscape precipitated - and later supported - pro wrestling's mainstream popularity. It is a story of how a company made in the image of an intuitively brilliant risk-taker betrayed its original promise. It is a story of how a handful of men, each struggling with their own limitations, facilitated a public obsession that changed television forever.</p><p>And so, with the inside knowledge of a journalist, the perspective of a historian, and the passion of a fan, author Guy Evans provides a fresh look at an unfortunate inevitability - the downfall of World Championship Wrestling. Bolstered by exclusive interviews with over 120 former TBS and WCW employees, NITRO is the definitive picture of the last wrestling boom.</p><p>Featuring exclusive interviews and comments from:</p><p>Eric Bischoff, fmr.

In alternating chapters, each of the four girls describes a meeting. There is aspiring poet Emma, whose librarian mother started the group; Jess, Emma&#39;s best friend, who lives on an organic farm; hockey-playing Cassidy, daughter of a former supermodel; and popular Megan. Despite their initial resistance to the club, the girls experience joys and sorrows and develop a closer bond, just like the characters that they grow to love. Plenty of detail and musing about Little Women will entice readers to pick up the book if they have not yet read it, but familiarity with Alcott&#39;s classic isn&#39;t required to enjoy this story.

Revised and updated to reflect recent Russian and Western scholarship on the subject, much of it the authors' own work, this new edition maintains the 1995 original's distinction as a crucial volume in the history of World War II and of the Soviet Union and the most informed and compelling perspective on one of the greatest military confrontations of all time.<br><br>In 1941, when Pearl Harbor shattered America's peacetime pretensions, the German blitzkrieg had already blasted the Red Army back to Moscow. Yet, less than four years later, the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flew above the ruins of Berlin, stark symbol of a miraculous comeback that destroyed the Germany Army and put an end to Hitler's imperial designs. In swift and stirring prose, When Titans Clash provides the clearest, most complete account of this epic struggle, especially from the Soviet perspective. Drawing on the massive and unprecedented release of Soviet archival documents in recent decades, David Glantz, one of the world's foremost authorities on the Soviet military, and noted military historian Jonathan House expand and elaborate our picture of the Soviet war effort&#x2014;a picture sharply different from accounts that emphasize Hitler's failed leadership over Soviet strategy and might.<br><br>Rafts of newly available official directives, orders, and reports reveal the true nature and extraordinary scale of Soviet military operations as they swept across the one thousand miles from Moscow to Berlin, featuring stubborn defenses and monumental offensives and counteroffensives and ultimately costing the two sides combined a staggering twenty million casualties. Placing the war within its wider context, the authors also make use of recent revelations to clarify further the political, economic, and social issues that influenced and reflected what happened on the battlefield. Their work gives us new insight into Stalin's political motivation and Adolf Hitler's role as warlord, as well as a better understanding of the human and economic costs of the war&#x2014;for both the Soviet Union and Germany.<br><br>While incorporating a wealth of new information, <i>When Titans Clashed</i> remains remarkably compact, a tribute to the authors' determination to make this critical chapter in world history as accessible as it is essential.</p><p>David M. Glantz and Jonathan M. House have collaborated on numerous volumes of military history, including <i>The Stalingrad Trilogy</i> and <i>The Battle of Kursk</i>.<b>Praise for the first edition:</b><br><br>"Now, Western readers can learn for the first time the full extent of the Soviet achievement.

The author-illustrator traces his father&#39;s imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp through a series of disarming and unusual cartoons arranged to tell the story as a novel.</p><p>Some historical events simply beggar any attempt at description--the Holocaust is one of these. Therefore, as it recedes and the people able to bear witness die, it becomes more and more essential that novel, vigorous methods are used to describe the indescribable. Examined in these terms, Art Spiegelman's <i>Maus</i> is a tremendous achievement, from a historical perspective as well as an artistic one. <p> Spiegelman, a stalwart of the underground comics scene of the 1960s and '70s, interviewed his father, Vladek, a Holocaust survivor living outside New York City, about his experiences. The artist then deftly translated that story into a graphic novel. By portraying a true story of the Holocaust in comic form--the Jews are mice, the Germans cats, the Poles pigs, the French frogs, and the Americans dogs--Spiegelman compels the reader to <i>imagine</i> the action, to fill in the blanks that are so often shied away from. Reading <i>Maus</i>, you are forced to examine the Holocaust anew.</p><p> This is neither easy nor pleasant. However, Vladek Spiegelman and his wife Anna are resourceful heroes, and enough acts of kindness and decency appear in the tale to spur the reader onward (we also know that the protagonists survive, else reading would be too painful). This first volume introduces Vladek as a happy young man on the make in pre-war Poland. With outside events growing ever more ominous, we watch his marriage to Anna, his enlistment in the Polish army after the outbreak of hostilities, his and Anna's life in the ghetto, and then their flight into hiding as the Final Solution is put into effect. The ending is stark and terrible, but the worst is yet to come--in the second volume of this Pulitzer Prize-winning set. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>"Maus is a book that cannot be put down, truly, even to sleep. When two of the mice speak of love, you are moved, when they suffer, you weep. Slowly through this little tale comprised of suffering, humor and life's daily trials, you are captivated by the language of an old Eastern European family, and drawn into the gentle and mesmerizing rhythm, and when you finish Maus, you are unhappy to have left that magical world."--Umberto Eco<br></p><h2>My Princess Boy</h2><p><b>A heartwarming book about unconditional love and one remarkable family. </b><br><br>Dyson loves pink, sparkly things.

Edgar Allan Poe, the&nbsp;legendary author of &#x201c;The Raven&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Tell-Tale&nbsp;Heart,&#x201d; used to recite poetry and dress up as a ghost to&nbsp;frighten grown-ups at parties.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the poet Langston Hughes spent hours in his&nbsp;local library, reading collections of mythology, verse,&nbsp;and African American history.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other kid authors had to overcome obstacles on the&nbsp;road to success. Laura Ingalls Wilder, the writer of&nbsp;<i>Little House on the Prairie</i>, grew up on the frontier,&nbsp;where she faced harsh winters and attacks by locusts.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then there is J. K. Rowling. Long before she&nbsp;wrote the best-selling Harry Potter novels, she was just&nbsp;another kid in middle school trying to make decent&nbsp;grades and fend off bullies.

Seaver was the host of the national television program <i>In Search of Food </i>on the Ovation Network and <i>Eat: The History of Food</i> on National Geographic TV.&#x201c;Chef Seaver (<i>For Cod and Country</i>) distills his vast knowledge of seafood in this encyclopedic work. Noting that today&#x2019;s technology allows for frozen fish to be just as good as, if not better than, the fresh seafood in stores, Seaver shares the best preparations for over 100 species. Each entry opens with an overview of a species and its aliases (Acadian redfish is sometimes sold as rosefish or ocean perch), along with preparations &#x2014;grilling, roasting, poaching, and others&#x2014;and acceptable substitutes for when you can&#x2019;t find a specific fish (e.g., jack and tilapia can be substituted for meaty grouper). There are 15 recipes for shrimp, 19 for oysters, 25 recipes that call for canned anchovies, and more than 30 for salmon. His selections are smart: fried haddock en adobo, halibut gravlax with dill, and sauteed sablefish with rosemary and Madeira wine.

But that's not surprising, considering that her family runs the town funeral home. And even though Great-uncle Edisto keeled over with a heart attack and Great-great-aunt Florentine dropped dead--just like that--six months later, Comfort knows how to deal with loss, or so she thinks. She's more concerned with avoiding her crazy cousin Peach and trying to figure out why her best friend, Declaration, suddenly won't talk to her. Life is full of surprises. And the biggest one of all is learning what it takes to handle them.<br> <br>Deborah Wiles has created a unique, funny, and utterly real cast of characters in this heartfelt, and quintessentially Southern coming-of-age novel. Comfort will charm young readers with her wit, her warmth, and her struggles as she learns about life, loss, and ultimately, triumph.<br></p><p>Death is a way of life for the Snowberger family, since they run a funeral parlor out of their Mississippi home with the motto "We live to serve." Still, when 94-year-old Great-great-aunt Florentine Snowberger dies in the vegetable garden, no one can truly be prepared, even though she'd been bidding "good night and good-bye" to the family every night since she turned 90. Florentine's death is hard on 10-year-old Comfort, since the two were so close, even co-writing the <i>Fantastic (and Fun) Funeral Food for Family and Friends</i>. It's no surprise, then, when the annoyingly overwrought emotional displays of her young cousin Peach Shuggars and the sudden iciness of her alleged best friend Declaration Johnson send Comfort over the edge. Thank goodness for her shaggy "feel-good" dog Dismay who can eradicate all bad feelings with a single slobbery lick.<p> When a dangerous flash flood comes to Snapfinger on the day of Florentine's funeral, Comfort learns again that life is full of surprises, good and bad, and that, ultimately, it's just good to be alive. This warm, witty novel, told in Comfort's voice (and a mix of letters, recipes, articles, and helpful hints), celebrates the joys of family, of prune bread, of freshly sharpened pencils, and of "each little bird that sings." The fairly constant philosophizing about life and death, the unusual character names (Tidings, Comfort, Joy), and the narrator's oft-precocious voice may fray a nerve or two, but readers will find more than enough humor and good old-fashioned storytelling here to make up for it.

Trying to hide his disappointment, Omri puts the Indian in a metal cupboard and locks the door with a mysterious skeleton&nbsp;key that once belonged to his great-grandmother. Little does Omri know that by turning the key, he will transform his ordinary plastic Indian into a real live man from an altogether different time and place! Omri and the tiny warrior called Little Bear could hardly be more different, yet soon the two forge a very special friendship. Will Omri be able to keep Little Bear without anyone finding out and taking his precious Indian from him?</p><p>What could be better than a magic cupboard that turns small toys into living creatures? Omri's big brother has no birthday present for him, so he gives Omri an old medicine cabinet he's found. Although their mother supplies a key, the cabinet still doesn't seem like much of a present. But when an exhausted Omri dumps a plastic toy Indian into the cabinet just before falling asleep, the magic begins. Turn the key once and the toy comes alive; turn it a second time and it's an action figure again. <p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is one of those rare books that is equally appealing to children and adults. The story of Omri and the Indian, Little Bear, is replete with subtle reminders of the responsibilities that accompany friendship and love. For kids, it's a great yarn; for most parents, it's also a reminder that Omri's wrenching decision to send his toy back to its own world is not so different from the recognition of their children's emerging independence. </p><p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is also available in Spanish (<i>La Llave Magica</i>.)

Commanded by an angel of God to flee Israel, Elijah seeks safety in the land of Zarephath, where he unexpectedly finds true love with a young widow. But this newfound rapture is to be cut short, and Elijah sees all of his hopes and dreams irrevocably erased as he is swept into a whirlwind of events that threatens his very existence. </p> <p> Written with the same masterful prose and clarity of vision that made <i>The Alchemist </i>an international phenomenon, <i>The Fifth Mountain</i> is a quietly moving account of a man touched by the hand of God who must triumph over his frustrations in a soul-shattering trial of faith. </p></p><p>With <i>The Fifth Mountain</i>, Paulo Coelho turns his talent for spiritual fiction to the story of the Biblical prophet Elijah. Like a blossoming flower, Coelho opens up the brief account of Elijah's flight from Gilead and his time in Zarephath. He deepens the prophet's character by revealing the thoughts, doubts, and discoveries that Elijah must have experienced as he struggled to find his course in life amidst the confusion of war and political turmoil. When being a prophet of the God of the Israelites is like a warrant for your death, concerns about your chosen path are sure to arise. Perhaps it is this believability in Coelho's retelling that makes it so evocative, or it may be the bit of Old Testament wisdom he brings to popular literature of the 20th century: "the words of the lord are written in the world around us.

Though Israel's world was in the throes of upheaval, it was only a matter of time before the sun of righteousness would rise. These people needed rescue, but they weren't waiting for the stars to align or for the political climate to change. They were waiting for God. They were on <em>his</em> timetable. He was sending his Messiah&#x2015;Immanuel, God with us." For centuries God's people awaited the coming of a Savior. In the midst of a world of trouble, they hoped for one who would deliver them from evil and restore them to true life. Would God be faithful to his promises? Pastor Russ Ramsey narrates anew the greatest story ever told&#x2015;the true tale of the coming of the Christ. It's more than the story of a baby born in Bethlehem; the story encompasses the whole of the Old Testament and all of human history, unveiling God's longsuffering, loving pursuit of his people. Rediscover how the purposes of God culminated in the coming of Jesus, in twenty-five readings ideal for Christmas or any season of meeting the Savior. Also including <em>The Passion of the King of Glory</em> and <em>The Mission of the Body of Christ</em>, the Retelling the Story series explores the narrative arc of the Bible from Genesis through Revelation in compelling language that is faithful to the text of Scripture. The stories are told afresh to help readers hide God's word in their hearts by way of their imaginations.</p><p>"Russ Ramsey has that rare gift&#x2015;the ability to animate the imagination.

P. Beaumont Novel, 1)</h2><p><p>The little girl was a treasure who should have been cherished, not murdered. She was only five-too young to die-and Homicide Detective J.P. Beaumont of the Seattle Police Department isn&#x2032;t going to rest until her killer pays dearly. But Beaumont&#x2032;s own obsessions and demons could prove dangerous companions in a murky world of blind faith and religious fanaticism. And he is about to find out that he himself is the target of a twisted passion . . . and a love that can kill.</p></p><p><p>J. A. Jance is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, the Ali Reynolds series, and five interrelated thrillers about the Walker family, as well as a volume of poetry. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>A little girl is murdered, and a mysterious woman in red comes to the funeral. Both events unalterably change the life of Homicide Detective J.P. Beaumont. Engene starts off well with deep, gruff tones perfect for an older, big city cop. Unfortunately, though, he has a tendency towards the melodramatic which often overshadows the irony of the text. He handles the frequent (though not graphic) sex scenes well, realizing the author&#39;s objective is to portray obsession rather than titillate. One jarring note is his selection of voice for a minor character--the girlish, lisping whine for a gay character has no place in these supposedly enlightened times. S.F.

It's difficult to fit in when plant eaters can be so cruel&#x2014;just because you ate a relative of theirs that one time! What's a carnivore to do? Aaron Reynolds's roaringly funny text is perfectly paired with Dan Santat's mouthwatering illustrations, creating a toothsome book that's sure to stand out from the herd.</p><p>Aaron Reynolds has written many delicious books for kids including the Caldecott Honor Book <em>Creepy Carrots</em>. Though Aaron spent six years as a vegetarian, he is now a committed carnivore. He lives in Chicago.<br><br>Dan Santat is the illustrator of many acclaimed books and the creator of Disney's animated hit <em>The Replacements</em>. He lives in Southern California with his wife, two kids, a rabbit, a bird, and one cat.K-Gr 2&#x2013;The cartoon animals in this picture book bear a distinct resemblance to the expressive animals of the big screen. These wide-eyed carnivores have a peculiar problem: their feelings are hurt because the other critters do not appreciate their eating habits. The humorous text follows a great white shark, a timber wolf, and a lion as they strive to fit in. At first, they think becoming vegetarians will help. They even form a support group. But despite their efforts, they realize they just can't change their appetites. Then, they don disguises and try to blend in, but their socializing attempts end poorly. A wise, old owl explains, &#x201c;I'm not bad. I'm a carnivore. Eating meat is just what I do.&#x201d; The three predators like the advice so much that they eat the owl. The adorable bunnies don't fare well either. This book is not for the squeamish. Part personal acceptance mantra, part no-holds-barred buffet, it's funny in the same vein as Michelle Knudsen's Big Mean Mike (Candlewick, 2012). While not all readers will like the food-chain cruelty or enjoy the sometimes mixed messages, this will be a favorite for rowdy read-alouds. The well-paced text moves quickly and is paired deliciously with the bold, colorful illustrations. The grizzly heroes even eat the animals in the endpapers. Grim and chuckle-inducing from cover to cover.&#x2013;Leila Sterman, Chappaqua Library, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

Which is why, on Discworld, only the experts can manage it&#x2014;the venerable Monks of History who store it and pump it from where it's wasted, like underwater (how much time does a codfish <em>really</em> need?) to places like cities, where busy denizens lament never having enough of it.</p><p>While everyone talks about slowing down, one young horologist is about to do the unthinkable. He's going to stop. Well, stop time, that is, by building the world's first truly accurate clock. Which means esteemed History Monk Lu-Tze and his apprentice Lobsang Ludd have to put on some speed to stop the timepiece before it starts. For if the Perfect Clock starts ticking, time&#x2014;as we know it&#x2014;will end.

Unfamiliar with Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series? It's time to discover one of the funniest, most literate, and most thought-provoking authors writing today. <p> The Monks of History live in a Tibetan sort of area known as "enlightenment country." Their job: "to see that tomorrow happens at all." A mysterious Lady wants time-obsessed Jeremy Clockson to build a totally accurate glass clock. It will trap time and stop it, eliminating humanity's irritating unpredictability. This would make the Auditors, who observe the universe and enforce the rules governing it, very happy. It would also put Death out of a job, which the Grim Reaper <i>isn't</i> happy about. Fortunately, the History Monks have encountered this situation before; in fact, Lu Tze, the Sweeper, has <i>personally</i> dealt with it before. Even better, he has a new, gifted apprentice, Lobsang Ludd, the "thief of time." <i>This</i> time, they'll stop trouble before it can start! To add chaos to the mix, there's the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse--the one who quit before they became famous.</p><p> Although there <i>are</i> 25 other Discworld novels and many of the characters appeared first in previous books, you don't need to have read even one to enjoy <i>The Thief of Time</i>.

In a spotlight stands Alan Strang, a lean boy of seventeen, in sweater and jeans. In front of him, the horse nugget. Alan's pose represents a contour of great tenderness: his head is pressed against the shoulder of the horse, his hands stretching up to fondle its head.</p><p>The horse in turn nuzzles his neck.</p><p>The flame of a cigarette lighter jumps in the dark. Lights come up slowly on the circle. On the left bench, downstage, Martin Dysart, smoking. A man in his mid-forties.</p><p>Dysart: With one particular horse, called Nugget, he embraces. The animal digs its sweaty brow into his cheek, and they stand in the dark for an hour -- like a necking couple. And of all nonsensical things -- I keep thinking about the horse! Not the boy: the horse, and what it may be trying to do. I keep seeing that huge head kissing him with its chained mouth. Nudging through the metal some desire absolutely irrelevant to filling its belly or propagating its own kind. What desire could that be? Not to stay a horse any longer? Not to remain reined up for ever in those particular genetic strings? Is it possible, at certain moments we cannot imagine, a horse can add its sufferings together -- the non-stop jerks and jabs that are its daily life -- and turn them into grief? What use is grief to a horse?</p><p>[Alan leads Nugget out of the square and they disappear together up the tunnel, the horse's hooves scraping delicately on the wood.</p><p>Dysart rises, and addresses both the large audience in the theatre and the smaller one on stage.]</p><p>You see, I'm lost. What use, I should be asking, are questions like these to an overworked psychiatrist in a provincial hospital? They're worse than useless; they are, in fact, subversive.</p><p>[He enters the square. The light grows brighter.]</p><p>The thing is, I'm desperate. You see, I'm wearing that horse's head myself. That's the feeling. All reined up in old language and old assumptions, straining to jump clean-hoofed on to a whole new track of being I only suspect is there. I can't see it, because my educated, average head is being held at the wrong angle. I can't jump because the bit forbids it, and my own basic force -- my horsepower, if you like -- is too little. The only thing I know for sure is this: a horse's head is finally unknowable to me. Yet I handle children's heads -- which I must presume to be more complicated, at least in the area of my chief concern...In a way, it has nothing to do with this boy. The doubts have been there for years, piling up steadily in this dreary place. It's only the extremity of this case that's made them active. I know that. The extremity is the point! All the same, whatever the reason, they are now, these doubts, not just vaguely worrying -- but intolerable...I'm sorry. I'm not making much sense. Let me start properly; in order.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ- centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition. Projected contributors to the series include notable authors such as Russell D. Moore, Al Mohler, Matt Chandler, Francis Chan, Mark Dever, and others.</p><p><b>Dr. Andrew Davis (Ph.D. Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, KY) is senior pastor of First Baptist Durham, NC, where he has served since 1998. In 2005 he also joined Southeastern Seminary as Visiting Professor of Historical Theology. He presently serves on the board of The Gospel Coalition and is a trustee of the IMB. He is the author of An Infinite Journey and An Approach to the Extended Memorization of Scripture. He and his wife Christi reside in Bahama, NC, and have five children. </b>It's one thing to know Bible stories; it's another to know the story of the Bible. It's one thing to be aware of the story's many heroes; it's another to have met the Hero himself. From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series. It models for preachers and teachers how to proclaim&#x2014;with pastoral focus and exegetical care&#x2014;the beauty of the gospel from every page of Scripture.<br><br><b>Matt Smethurst</b><br> Associate Editor for The Gospel Coalition<br><br> Few things are more important for faithful biblical interpretation than reading Scripture in light of its master narrative. The Christ-Centered Exposition series aims to do just that.&nbsp; In a postmodern age, these commentaries provide pastors and lay people an invaluable resource that is unswervingly committed to the authority of Scripture and the centrality of the Gospel in the Bible&#x2019;s storyline.<br><br><b>Dr. R. Albert Mohler Jr., President</b><br> The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br> &#x201c;I welcome Pastor Andy Davis&#x2019;s contribution to the Christ-Centered Exposition Series. His love of the Scriptures and his love of the Savior are equally well represented in his exposition of Isaiah. Davis applies his wealth of pastoral experience with remarkable contemporary references to make this commentary insightful, accessible and useful for congregations as well as pastors.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Bryan Chapell </b>&#x2013; pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church, Peoria, Illinois; founder and chairman of Unlimited Grace, a radio and online Bible-teaching ministry; and President Emeritus of Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As a part of the Christ-Centered Exposition series, Andy Davis&#x2019; devotional commentary on Isaiah fits well. I have known Dr. Davis for many years and he is one of the most careful, thoughtful, biblically-centered theologians I know. Davis well affirms Christ in Isaiah, and ties in the unified story of redemptive history of which Jesus Christ is preeminent. The book contains easy to read, rich, practical, sermonic presentations of each chapter of Isaiah that will be a great resource for any pastor or teacher working through his prophecy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Eric A. Mitchell</b> &#x2013; associate professor of Old Testament &amp; Archaeology, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Without a doubt Isaiah is one of the most important books in the Old Testament, and the New Testament use of Isaiah gives it a particular significance. Andy Davis&#x2019;s commentary is a helpful addition to studies on Isaiah at several levels. He takes seriously the historical message of Isaiah so that he doesn't simply leap to the New Testament and avoid the Old Testament context. At the same time, the fulfillment of Isaiah in the New Testament receives careful and wise attention. Finally, Davis applies the message of Isaiah to today's world. I recommend this work enthusiastically.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Thomas R. Schreiner</b> &#x2013; James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This wonderful commentary by Andy Davis is <i>theological</i> through and through, with a focus upon the glory of God and the salvation he offers in Jesus the Messiah. Davis helps us see the urgency of Isaiah for today and apply the book to the church in practical terms. I warmly commend this commentary for pastors and theologians alike.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Heath A. Thomas</b> &#x2013; dean and professor of Old Testament, Herschel H. Hobbs College of Theology &amp; Ministry, Oklahoma Baptist University<br><br> &#x201c;Andy Davis is a faithful, seasoned expositor with theological depth and pastoral care, and in this volume he provides steady guidance for anyone endeavoring to preach the prophecy of Isaiah.

'The real magic is science,' writes Beccia (They Lost Their Heads!, 2018), and to back up the claim, she surrounds introductions to familiar fantastic creatures, from Dracula to Bigfoot, the Kraken, werewolves, and King Kong, with excursions into diverse scientific topics relevant to each. After leading off with a look at the chemical bases of fear and other emotions, for instance, an account of Mary Shelley's creation of Frankenstein's monster serves as entree for discussions of electricity, the experiments of Galvani and others, how defibrillators work, glowing pigs and other products of genetic experimentation, lobotomies, head transplants, and how certain breakfast-cereal dyes turn poop pink. Moreover, later chapters invite readers to sink their teeth into a vampiric timeline from ancient Babylonia and the Twilight saga, weigh King Kong's unlikely mass ratio ('Did Beauty or Math Kill the Beast?'), glimpse a deep-sea 'bone-eating snot-flower worm' chowing down on a dead whale, and assemble an official Centers for Disease Control zombie-preparedness kit that would, uncoincidentally, be just as useful in a pandemic or other natural disaster. The monsters are more comical than scary in the author's painted illustrations, and though her (living) cast defaults to white, she does include some brown-skinned figures. <strong>Informative and entertaining throughout for readers undead or otherwise.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Beccia explores the historical, scientific, and psychological origins of eight notorious monster characters, including Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, zombies, Bigfoot, and others.

Additional sections offer 'How to' tips on surviving creature attacks ('If you spot a baby Bigfoot, you might be tempted to play with it, especially if it is cute and furry. Don't'). Beccia explores the circumstances that contributed to the lore behind each being while bringing a scientific dimension to the playful concept. Alongside the text's logical explanations (Could the Kraken really be a giant squid?), there is fun to be had, and <strong>readers will savor details about how history, superstition, and human perception have inspired some of the most feared and beloved monster legends.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Science and history are scary fun subjects in Carlyn Beccia's fascinating dissection of eight storied creatures from film and folklore.</p><br><p>"Vampires, zombies, werewolves and other mythical monsters have induced fear in audiences for ages.

The mixed-media illustrations are macabre and quirky when fictionalized, while frighteningly accurate when depicting scientific and historical infographics. Balancing darker backgrounds with colorful contrasting text, each monster biography has a mix of paragraphs, diagrams, and time lines/scales. Each monster (perhaps) becomes a little less scary as readers start to understand the science behind each one. From the electricity that seemingly awoke Frankenstein's monster to the radiation that evidently created Godzilla, the science is systematically broken down. Although some of the information may be disturbing for younger readers, <strong>the connections to history and science also make the text fascinating and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny. </strong>VERDICT Avid fans of dinosaurs, animals, science, history, scary stories, or, more specifically, R.L.

Beccia's tone is as accessibly irreverent as it was in <em>They Lost Their Heads! </em>(2018), and she plays no games here, cheerfully admitting that, while Bigfoot is almost surely a hoax, it's best to be prepared to know how to make a cast of his footprint should you happen upon one (instructions included).

Among his many awards was the Newbery Medal for his novel <em>The Whipping Boy</em>.

His other titles include <em>The Entertainer and the Dybbuk</em>, a novel, and three biographies, <em>Sir Charlie: Chaplin, The Funniest Man in the World</em>; <em>The Trouble Begins at 8: A Life of Mark Twain in the Wild, Wild West</em>; and <em>Escape!

These early experiences gave him admiration, curiosity, and insider information about his subject. As author, Fleischman, like narrator Taylor Mali and Houdini himself, grows more excited when the magician's career takes off. Though he won't reveal any magic secrets, Fleischman's writing fascinates listeners with vivid pictures. Mali adds his own magic, especially a fine sense of timing. Like the showman himself, Mali fascinates with renditions of Houdini's jail breaks and straight-jacket escapes. He expertly relates the mysteries of a man who still intrigues the world.

Andrew describes in fascinating detail and in a humorous and light hearted manner the secret lives of our many different sea creatures, or beasties as he likes to call them. The book is crammed full of interesting facts and is written in a straight forward succinct and informative way making it is easy for the layman to read and understand. He delves into the lives of jelly fish, limpets, mussels and many other species, uncovering their often bizarre behavior and sometimes scary predatory techniques and feeding habits which most ordinary people could barely imagine existed. Who would guess a whelk slowly drills into the shell of its unfortunate victims, or that cone shells harpoon their victims with poison bearing teeth? Andrew also dispels many myths and misunderstandings, for example that the Portuguese man of War is not even a jelly fish at all but instead a colony of connected creatures. Who would guess that the limpet is actually a one footed creature which slides around like a snail, having a home base surrounding a feeding territory? These are just some of the many fascinating facts which Andrew uncovers in his book. Throughout the book the reader is kept entertained by Andrew&#x2019;s unique writing style and amusing turn of phrase. On a more serious note Andrew also discusses the importance of coral reefs and their vital role in supporting human livelihoods. Andrew also reveals his true passion for marine biology and his deep concern that many of our species could be under threat due to overfishing of the humble krill. Andrew&#x2019;s work may well motivate people to take a more active interest in the study and preservation of our rich and diverse marine life. As Andrew points out, there is even more still to discover and who knows maybe one day a cure for cancer may be even be developed from understanding toxins in marine animals. "I am extremely impressed. It&#x2019;s written in an easy to understand fashion, with good humour in parts which gives the reader a sense of enthusiasm and knowledge. It&#x2019;s extremely interesting and informative and a must for any student wishing to take a career in marine biology, or for anyone wishing to know more about the sea. Very enjoyable read!"&#x2014;Esther B., eBook Reader "Andrew&#x2019;s book is a conversation with the sea. He gives us the chance to learn more than perhaps we ever planned on without realizing that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re doing&#x2014;and without being too serious. This book is that memorable experience we all have of hearing someone narrate or speak while we stand in awe in front of a screen or massive aquarium, but we&#x2019;re creating our own images as we read along, and when we&#x2019;re finished we&#x2019;re ready to run out the door and connect the dots in person. In that way, Andrew Caine is so successful with this book at inspiring curiosity!"&#x2014;Sarah J., eBook Reader "As a non biologist but a keen diver who loves marine wildlife and has met many of the amazing creatures described in this book, it was fascinating to appreciate a deeper understanding of the relationships between certain species, their biological evolution and functions and how they fit into the marine eco system. This book is certainly well detailed but not too off putting for the non biologist, it explains processes and behaviour in a very understandable way and is extremely interesting without being overwhelming. I would thoroughly recommend this book to the diving community interested in marine wildlife."&#x2014;Simon O., Diver Check out the website www.marinebiologybook.com for more information</p><p></p><h2>Good Night Tennessee (Good Night Our World)</h2><p>Good Night Tennessee features Lookout Mountain and Rock City, Tennessee Aquarium, Davy Crockett Cabin, Tennessee Railroad, Smoky Mountains, blues musicians, bluegrass music, barbeque, Nashville, and more.

The vegetation creeping upward in places, ivy and weeds tangling with the bars, and the way they&#x2019;d light up in a storm, encircling the house&#x2014;�a stark surprise against the darkness.<br><br>And we were on the inside.<br><br>It was better to see it from this direction, on the way out. It looked different as I grew older. From the other side, through a different filter. A glance over my shoulder as I walked away, and all I could see were the cameras over the entrances. The sterile, boxed walls of the house beyond. The shadow behind the tinted window.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t realize, for a long time, that this was the secret.<br><br>Still, there was a familiarity to the iron gates, and I couldn&#x2019;t help tapping them as I passed each morning, a routine goodbye as I left for the day. In the summer, the bars would be hot from the sun. And in the winter, when I was bundled up in wool, sometimes I&#x2019;d feel a spark underneath the cold, like I could sense the �current of electricity that was running through the top.<br><br>Mostly, though, they felt like home.<br><br>Today, my palm came away damp, coated with morning dew. Everything glistened in the mountain sunrise.<br><br>Now that I was beyond the gates, and because I saw my mother&#x2019;s shadow, there was a routine I was supposed to stick to:<br><br>Check the backseat through the windows before unlocking the car door.<br><br>Start the car and count to twenty so the engine had time to settle.<br><br>Wave to my mother, watching from the front window.<br><br>Two hands on the wheel as I navigated the unpaved driveway made of gravel, and then the winding mountain roads on the way to school.<br><br>The rest of the day was a tally of hours, a routine I knew by heart. Swap this Wednesday for any other Wednesday and nobody would notice. My mother said there&#x2019;s a safety to routine, but I didn&#x2019;t exactly agree. Routines could be learned. Routines could be predicted. But it would be a mistake to say that. Honestly, it was a mistake to even think that.<br><br>Here was the rest of my Wednesday routine:<br><br>Arrive at school early enough to get a parking spot near a streetlight, since I&#x2019;d be leaving late. Avoid the crowded hallway, hope Mr. Graham opened his classroom early. Claim my seat in the back of math class, and coast through the day, mostly unnoticed.<br><br>Mostly.<br><br>My books were already out and I&#x2019;d just about finished the morning problems when Ryan Baker swept into class.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Kelsey,&#x201d; he said as he slid into his seat, just as the bell rang.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Ryan,&#x201d; I said. This was also part of the routine. Ryan looked the way Ryan always looked, which was: brown hair that never fell the same way twice; legs too long for the desk beneath him, so they stretched under the seat in front or to the aisle between us (today: aisle); jeans, brown lace-�up boots, T-shirt. Autumn in Vermont meant a sweatshirt for me, but apparently Ryan hadn&#x2019;t gotten there yet.<br><br>Today he was wearing a dark blue shirt that said volunteer, and he caught me staring. I didn&#x2019;t know if it was supposed to be ironic or not.<br><br>His fingers drummed on the desk. His knee bounced in the aisle.<br><br>I almost asked him, on impulse, but then Mr. Graham called me up to the board for a problem, and Ryan started drawing on his wrist with blue ink, and by the time I returned to my seat, the moment had passed.<br><br>First period was mostly quiet and mostly still. People yawned, people stretched, occasionally someone rested their head on their desk and hoped Mr. Graham didn&#x2019;t notice. Everyone slowly came to life over the span of ninety minutes.<br><br>But Ryan always seemed the opposite&#x2014;�all coiled energy, even at eight a.m. Rushing into class, his leg bouncing under his desk, his hands continually drawing patterns. His energy was contagious. So by the time the bell rang, I was the one coiled to jump. I&#x2019;d spring from my seat, wave goodbye, head down the hall toward English, and pretend we hadn&#x2019;t once shared the most embarrassing conversation of my life.<br><br>The rest of the daily routine: English, lunch, science, history. Faces I&#x2019;d grown accustomed to seeing over the last two years. Names I knew well, people I knew casually. The day passing by in a comfortable string of sameness. Blink too long and you might miss it.<br><br>Wednesday also meant tutoring after school to meet the volunteer component for graduation. Since I was a year ahead of most everyone in my grade, taking mostly senior classes, this was the easiest way to fulfill it.<br><br>Today I was scheduled to start with Leo Johnson, a senior taking sophomore science who I kind of knew from the Lodge. Kind of knew because (a) Leo was the type of person that everyone kind of knew, and (b) Ryan and I shared a shift at the Lodge twice a week over the summer, and they were friends. Which meant when Leo came in, he would occasionally nod at me, and even less occasionally mention me by name.<br><br>He dropped his notebook on the table across from me. &#x201c;Hi, my name is Leo, and I&#x2019;m failing.&#x201d; He flashed me a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, hi, we know each other already.&#x201d;<br><br>He slouched, narrowing his eyes. &#x201c;Yes, but did you also know I was failing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seeing as you&#x2019;re assigned to be here after school on a Wednesday, I kind of assumed. Even more telling that you didn&#x2019;t bring any books.&#x201d;<br><br>He tipped his head to the side and scrunched up his mouth like he was thinking something through.<br><br>I looked at the clock. Only two minutes had passed. He didn&#x2019;t even have a pencil. &#x201c;Look, I get credit whether I help you or we just sit here staring at each other. Just let me know which you prefer.&#x201d;<br><br>He stifled a laugh. &#x201c;Okay, Kelsey Thomas,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I get it now.&#x201d; He gestured to my stack of textbooks. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this. I&#x2019;m told I do need to pass this class for graduation.&#x201d;<br><br>Leo turned out not to be the worst student in the world, though he was possibly the most easily distracted. He paused to talk to any person walking by the library entrance, and he checked the clock every five minutes or so.<br><br>His head shot up again an hour into our session when he heard footsteps in the hall, and he called, &#x201c;Hey, Baker!&#x201d; even though it was the library and he echoed. Leo was the type who didn&#x2019;t mind the attention&#x2014;�good or bad.<br><br>Ryan slowed at the library entrance but didn&#x2019;t quite stop. &#x201c;Gotta run. Later, man.&#x201d; Then his eye caught mine, and he lifted his hand in a half wave. &#x201c;Bye, Kelsey.&#x201d;<br><br>I half raised my hand in response.<br><br>Leo laughed under his breath. When I looked back at him, he was still grinning.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt my face heating up. I gripped the pencil harder and jabbed it at the paper, waiting for Leo to refocus on the problem.<br><br>Thanks to my mother, I was way ahead in terms of school material. But I was too far behind in everything else.

The librarian was gone. The halls were silent and empty, except for the hum of the vending machines tucked into the corner. I slid a crisp dollar from my wallet, fed it to the machine.

At thirty-six, she had a marriage that worked, two funny, active kids, and a weekly newspaper column. But even as a thriving adult, Kelly still saw herself as the daughter of garrulous Irish-American charmer George Corrigan. She was living deep within what she calls the Middle Place--&#34;that sliver of time when parenthood and childhood overlap&#34;--comfortably wedged between her adult duties and her parents&#39; care. But Kelly is abruptly shoved into coming-of-age when she finds a lump in her breast--and gets the diagnosis no one wants to hear. When George, too, learns that he has late-stage cancer, it is Kelly&#39;s turn to take care of the man who had always taken care of her--and to show us a woman who finally takes the leap and grows up.</p><p><strong>Kelly Corrigan</strong> is, more than anything else, the mother of two young girls. While they're at school, Kelly writes a newspaper column, the occasional magazine article, and possible chapters of a novel. She is also the creator of CircusOfCancer.org, a website that teaches people how to help a friend through breast cancer. Kelly lives outside San Francisco with her husband, Edward Lichty, and their children.Alternating between childhood reminiscences and present-day events, this engaging memoir of growing up in a small town evokes an OUR TOWN sensibility, which will leave listeners amused, sympathetic, and occasionally teary. When Kelly, a young mother of two small children, and her beloved, larger-than-life father are simultaneously diagnosed with cancer, listeners will quickly become involved with the events that follow. Tavia Gilbert's performance fully captures Corrigan's youthful exuberance, shock, and evolving maturity as she contends with doctors, chemotherapy, and the fear of leaving her children motherless and losing her father. Her father's boisterous energy and expansive can-do personality are also brought vividly to life. This performance will especially resonate with anyone who has ever experienced the ups and downs of a cancer diagnosis.

Granpappy's commitment to his old friend is frustrating for Mr. Hill, a tractor salesman, and a bit mysterious to his young grandson Micah. After all, it has cracked tires, a worn-out seat cushion, and no cab enclosure. Mr. Hill's lot, on the other hand, is full of bright, shiny vehicles with heat, air conditioning, and even sound systems. The salesman bets 20 jelly doughnuts that the old tractor won't make it through the season. But Granpappy uses it to plow, plant, mow, rake, and bale 20 acres of hay-and it even starts up smoothly when it's needed to pull Mr. Hill's car out of a mud puddle. Cowley combines pleasantly evocative language ("The rest of spring came through at a gallop") with a straightforward plot and minimal but effective characterization to create an engaging story. Dunrea's gouache illustrations are reminiscent of Nancy Wilson Parker's flat, simple style, showing readers an old-fashioned farm, a tow-headed Micah clad in overalls, and a mustachioed Granpappy. Their static charm suits the low-key story perfectly. Given the popularity of books about farms, families, and "things that go," this title will appeal to a wide audience.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Macram� Plant Hangers: Creative Knotted Crafts for Your Stylish Home</h2><p><b>Adorn your cozy interiors with 30 hand-woven DIY art and hanging plants.</b><br><br>Are you a DIY home decorator, plant lover, or flower lover?

The hidden history contained in this book will challenge modern paradigms. Suppressed information proves that California&#39;s legendary mountain is older and far more mysterious than previously imagined.</p><p><i><b>Mount Shasta's Mysterious Past . . .</b></i><br><br>This book is <i><b>NOT</b></i> about Native American spirituality or culture, which is beyond the scope of the material. It does, however, contain many prehistoric legends found in the region's historical record. Although this is a book mainly focused on Mount Shasta, many of the legends chronicled in the historical record also overlap into northern California and the cascade range of the Pacific Northwest. The thesis of this book largely relies on the statements and truthfulness of Native American sourced historical material, which can be verified in the bibliography. The author has compiled this material in hopes to gain a better understanding of the history and early legends of Mount Shasta, and the greater Pacific Northwest wilderness."Mount Shasta is an amazing, deeply mysterious and powerfully energetic place, and Dustin Naef's <b><i>Mount Shasta's Forgotten History &amp; Legends</i></b> is an important, thought-provoking book.

Shasta, or anyone who has interest in the phenomena there, as it takes a completely different tact from other books on the locale. With extensive research pulling from Native American lore and early history, the book reveals a different angle to many of the mysteries surrounding Mt. Shasta, and expands on them. Much of the information and connections in this book few people know about, and as you'll see, Dustin also has his experiences investigating some of the locations." - <b>John Vivanco</b>, Remote Viewing Teacher and author of <i>The Time Before the Secret Words: On the Path of Remote Viewing, High Strangeness and Zen</i><br><br>Author D.W.

Naraku's human origins may yet prove to be his downfall if Kikyo can exploit his weaknesses by forcing him to make a difficult choice, one that is mirrored by Inuyasha's lost love for Kikyo and a possible future with Kagome!</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for <i>Those Selfish Aliens</i>. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, <i>Urusei Yatsura</i>, was serialized in <i>Weekly Shonen Sunday</i>. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--<b><i>Maison Ikkoku</i></b> ran from 1980 to 1987, <b><i>Ranma</i></b> <b><i>1/2</i></b> from 1987 to 1996, and <b><i>Inuyasha</i></b> from 1996 to 2008.

Centuries later, each species still views the other with simmering animosity. Lately, the influential dwarf, Grag Hamcrusher, has been fomenting unrest among Ankh-Morpork's more diminutive citizens&#x2014;a volatile situation made far worse when the pint-size provocateur is discovered bashed to death . . . with a troll club lying conveniently nearby.</p><p>Commander Sam Vimes of the City Watch is aware of the importance of solving the Hamcrusher homicide without delay. (Vimes's second most-pressing responsibility, in fact, next to always being home at six p.m. sharp to read <em>Where's My Cow?</em> to Sam, Jr.) But more than one corpse is waiting for Vimes in the eerie, summoning darkness of a labyrinthine mine network being secretly excavated beneath Ankh-Morpork's streets. And the deadly puzzle is pulling him deep into the muck and mire of superstition, hatred, and fear&#x2014;and perhaps all the way to Koom Valley itself.</p></p><p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series. His young adult novel, <em>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</em>, won the Carnegie Medal, and <em>Where's My Cow?</em>, his Discworld book for &#x201c;readers of all ages,&#x201d; was a <em>New York Times </em>bestseller. His novels have sold more than seventy&nbsp;five&nbsp;million (give or take a few million) copies worldwide. Named an Officer of the British Empire &#x201c;for services to literature,&#x201d; Pratchett lived in England. He died in 2015 at the age of sixty-six.</p>"Where there is trouble, you will always find a troll." How true. How observant. How Pratchett. In his 34th Discworld novel, Terry Pratchett is at the top of his game, taking on honest cops, vampires, loyalty, fatherhood, and, of course, historic battlefield reenactments to create yet another irreverent, adventure-filled yarn. Gleefully finding both the parody and distinctive voice in each character, Stephen Briggs has a rip-roaring time creating a cornucopia of goofy British Isle accents. Briggs adds the right vocal tension and gravity at the right times as Commander Sam Vimes and the City Watch (a police force that dons "one size doesn't fit anybody" helmets) attempt to bring the murderer of four subterranean dwarfs to justice before another interspecies game of Thud! becomes all too real.

A twinkle-twinkle little star transforms into a twinkle-less, sunshine-eating-and rhyming Black Hole? What if amoebas, combustion, metamorphosis, viruses, the creation of the universe are all irresistible, laugh-out-loud poetry? Well, you're thinking in science verse, that's what. And if you can't stop the rhymes . . . the atomic joke is on you. Only the amazing talents of Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, the team who created Math Curse, could make science so much fun.</p></p><p>Multiple award-winning author Jon Scieszka grew up in Flint, Michigan, the second oldest and the nicest of six boys. Jon went to school at Culver Military Academy in Indiana where he was a Lieutenant; Albion College in Michigan where he studied to be a doctor; and Columbia University in New York, where he received an M.F.A. in fiction. He taught elementary school in New York for ten years in a variety of positions. He is the author of many books for children including the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Best Illustrated Book&nbsp;The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith), the Caldecott Honor book&nbsp;The True Story of the Three Little Pigs&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith), and&nbsp;Math Curse&nbsp;(illustrated by Lane Smith). &nbsp;In addition to his work as an author, Jon also runs a web-based literacy program called &#x201c;Guys Read&#x201d; that is designed to encourage boys, particularly reluctant readers, to get involved with books. In 2008, Jon was named the country&#x2019;s first National Ambassador for Young People&#x2019;s Literature, a joint effort of the Library of Congress and the Children&#x2019;s Book Council. During his two-year role as Ambassador, he acted as a spokesperson for children&#x2019;s literature, speaking to groups of parents, teachers, and children to encourage the importance of reading. You can visit Jon online at www.jsworldwide.com.Grade 2-5&#x2013;In <i>Math Curse</i> (Viking, 1995), a teacher's chance comment causes a girl to see every aspect of her life as a math problem. This time around, the fun starts when a boy hears this remark: "...if you listen closely enough, you can hear the poetry of science in everything." What follows is a series of poems that parody the styles of Joyce Kilmer, Edgar Allan Poe, Lewis Carroll, Robert Frost, and many others, as well as familiar songs and nursery rhymes. "Once in first grade I was napping/When I heard a scary yapping" begins a lament about studying dinosaurs year after year. In "Astronaut Stopping by a Planet on a Snowy Evening," the narrator bemoans the fact that he can't figure out what planet he's on because "In science class I was asleep...." Children need not be familiar with the works upon which the spoofs are based to enjoy the humor, but this is a perfect opportunity to introduce the originals and to discuss parody as a poetic form. The dynamic cartoons are an absolute delight. The expressions on the face of the beleaguered boy keep readers smiling and the pages are chock-full of funny details that are in perfect sync with the poems. Printed in a cream-colored, readable font and set against solid backgrounds, the text is never overwhelmed by the frenetic illustrations. Fans of Scieszka and Smith will be in heaven, but the book will appeal to one and all.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, Dark Horse is pleased to present the comics that started it all, collected in deluxe hardcover editions. Sized at a generous 9&#39; x 12&#39;, and handsomely bound to match The Art of Hellboy, each volume contains the equivalent of two full trade paperbacks.</p><p><b>Mike Mignola's</b> fascination with ghosts and monsters began at an early age; reading <i>Dracula</i> at age twelve introduced him to Victorian literature and folklore, from which he has never recovered. Starting in 1982 as a bad inker for Marvel Comics, he swiftly evolved into a not-so-bad artist. By the late 1980s, he had begun to develop his own unique graphic style, with mainstream projects like <i>Cosmic Odyssey</i> and <i>Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</i>. In 1994, he published the first <i>Hellboy</i> series through Dark Horse. There are thirteen <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novels (with more on the way), several spin-off titles (<i>B.P.R.D., Lobster Johnson, Abe Sapien, </i>and<i> Sir Edward Grey: Witchfinder</i>), prose books, animated films, and two live-action films starring Ron Perlman. Along the way he worked on Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer for Disney's<i> Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001), and was the visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004), and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</i> (2008). Mike's books have earned numerous awards and are published in a great many countries. Mike lives in Southern California with his wife, daughter, and cat.The second oversize collection of Mignola&#x2019;s infernal superhero consists entirely of the shorter stories that fill the gap in the unfolding big story started in the early Hellboys gathered in Hellboy, v.1 (2008) and resumed, a bit, in Strange Places (2006). It&#x2019;s pure Mignola, written and drawn, and it verifies his and editor Scott Allie&#x2019;s shared contention that horror is best suited to the short story, even when it is adulterated by Hellboy&#x2019;s wisecracks and exclamations of minor frustration while pummeling and being pummeled by supersize supernatural monsters. Try &#x201c;The Corpse&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Wolves of St. August&#x201d; for starters, then devour the rest of these terribly tasty concoctions. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Lena&#39;s Shoes Are Nervous: A First-Day-of-School Dilemma</h2><p>In the tradition of <i>School&#x2019;s First Day of School</i>, debut author Keith Calabrese and Pura Belpr� Award winner Juana Medina share a sweet, universal story about a clever little girl whose shoes are nervous about the first day of school.<br><br>Today is a big day!

I believe the fourteen statements of the Emerald Tablet to be a symbolic guide to a far greater treasure than the conversion of lead into gold. I believe it to be, instead, a symbolic guide to the awakening of the human soul. I believe it to be a guide to the conversion of a base and petty human being into an awakened soul, the likes of which we have seen in the Jesuses and the Buddhas of our world. In the Christian Bible, it is said that Adam fell into a deep sleep. Nowhere in that Bible does it say that he woke back up. The purpose of the Emerald Tablet, I believe, is that very awakening.</p><p>I began my journey into the ideas of the ancient Egyptians years ago while trying to study alchemy. At that time, the Emerald Tablet was a curiosity, but I made very little headway into the deeper meanings. Later, I studied the Hermetica and eventually the Kybalion and discovered that I really liked the philosophy of those teachings. I saw in the ancient Egyptian teachings both sides of the religious and spiritual thought that seem to make up our modern religions: the idea of a diety as found in Christianity and other western religions, but also the idea of awakening as in the Zen and Buddhist type traditions. For me this Egyptian philosophy has been the perfect merger, and maybe the original root, of these two sides of spiritual, philosophical and religious thought.&#34;This world is a holographic unity that repeats itself in an endless, infinite continuum in every direction forever.&#34;</p><h2>U.S. Army Explosives and Demolitions Handbook (US Army Survival)</h2><p>Military demolitions are the destruction by fire, water, explosive, and mechanical means of areas, structures, facilities, or materials to accomplish a military objective.

Naturally blessed with a readable and flowing style of writing, Larkin enlightened countless thousands of Christians during his lengthy career. <br><br> In this book, we receive a passage-by-passage, line-by-line examination of the Book of Daniel. No detail or phrase is passed over, and the reader may be assured that Larkin pays the closest attention in explaining this important yet difficult to understand part of the Holy Bible. Larkin was moved to author this and several other books after receiving word from his flock and fellow believers of the difficulties they had reading and interpreting such texts. <br><br> The chapters are divided into the major episodes underpinning the Book of Daniel. Events such as the dream of Nebuchadnezzer and the calamitous Fall of Babylon receive close narration, while the famous image of Daniel in the Lion's Den benefits greatly from the clarifying commentary of Larkin. <br><br> This edition of Larkin's Book of Daniel includes all of the intricate charts and illustrations for which the author became famous. Several of these are very large and detailed images with large, small and tiny instances of text, and it is doubtless necessary to use a magnifying glass to fully scrutinize them. Vital to Larkin's explanations, they set out visually the principles that this book exists to clarify for the reader.</p><p></p><h2>The Walking Dead Book 15</h2><p>Recent events have thrown Alexandria into turmoil, and now Rick, Dwight, Eugene and Negan all have something to prove.

Despite our best intentions, grades seem to reflect student compliance more than student learning and engagement. In the process, we inadvertently subvert the learning process.<br>After careful research and years of experiences with grading as a teacher and a parent, Cathy Vatterott examines and debunks traditional practices and policies of grading in K-12 schools. She offers a new paradigm for standards-based grading that focuses on student mastery of content and gives concrete examples from elementary, middle, and high schools. <em>Rethinking Grading</em> will show all educators how standards-based grading can authentically reflect student progress and learning--and significantly improve both teaching and learning.<br> Cathy Vatterott is an education professor and researcher at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, a former middle school teacher and principal, and a parent of a college graduate. She has learned from her workshops that grading continues to be the most contentious part . . . conjuring up the most intense emotions and heated disagreements.

Do you imagine that, if you could just change you appearance, you would be happier and more fulfilled? If you do, you might be dealing with the effects of a problem called body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).</p> <p>Individuals who suffer from BDD are excessively preoccupied with the shape or size of their body-obsessed with a facial blemish, a minor bodily defect, or some specific aspect of their appearance. They spend hours each day thinking about their perceived deformity, checking and rechecking their appearance in the mirror, camouflaging themselves with makeup or clothing. Men affected by a form of BDD known as muscle dysmorphia are obsessively concerned about their muscular development, no matter how large and pumped up they are. In extreme cases BDD leads to unnecessary plastic surgery, serious eating disorders, steroid abuse, and even suicide.</p> <p>The good news is that BDD is highly treatable with cognitive-behavioral techniques provided in <strong>The BDD Workbook</strong> in a step-by-step, easy-to-follow format. OCD experts Claiborn and Pedrick guide you through a proven intervention plan that helps you recognize your distorted self-perception and come to terms with how it leads you to self-inflicted emotional and physical pain. Exercises, charts, and worksheets help you to develop a healthier response to your body and a more balanced self-image. The book provides information about BDD-related eating disorders and the special problems of children with self-image issues. It also offers suggestions to help you gain support from family members, medical professionals, and support groups.</p> <p><em>This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit &#x2014; an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties.

He worries as he dresses and then he can?t sit still in the waiting room. Finally, it?s time to go in and change for his exam, but . . . OOOPS! He?s forgotten his underwear! And that?s just the beginning of Froggy?s hilarious doctor visit that ends reassuringly with a gold star and a lollipop.</p><p>Kids who go to the doctor for a routine checkup shouldn't worry too much.

The seminal event of my medical education in this regard was my own cure from chronic, unexplained knee pain with the guidance of John Sarno, MD from NYU's Rusk Institute. After this personal success, I performed a follow-up study of his patients, under his auspices and determined that this approach proved successful in a remarkably high 77% of chronic back sufferers. <p>As my career has progressed, I've developed my own program of treatment that includes an office consultation and educational seminar on this subject for my patients. I've developed a series of materials including audiotapes, article, video, and now this Workbook. I feel this Workbook offers the best opportunity for people suffering from mindbody disorders that I may not personally be able to treat. With the help of a local physician to exclude more serious disease, they should be able to benefit greatly from the thirty-day structured journal approach, on their own, as my own patients do in my office.</p>A thirty-day program of insight and awareness for back pain and other disorders.</p><h2>When&#39;s My Birthday?</h2><p><p>In this enthusiastic celebration of all things BIRTHDAY, acclaimed author Julie Fogliano and award-winning illustrator Christian Robinson bring you the perfect birthday book!

Fogliano's insistent verse wastes no time and doesn't even stop for traditional capitalization&#x2014;just like the young narrators, who want to know, "when's my birthday?/where's my birthday?/how many days until/my birthday?" They continue breathlessly, wondering if they will "sing so happy happy?" on the big day. The exaggerated excitement is echoed in Robinson's clever use of scale, as in a spread featuring a gigantic present tied with white twine. A little girl reaches up to pull the string, dwarfed by its size. The long and tall trim size is also ideal for displaying a towering, swimming pool&#x2014;size birthday cake so large that the young birthday boy needs a ladder to reach the candles. A muted palette of slate blue, mustard yellow, forest green, and burnt sienna, sometimes appearing on a rich black background, reflects the festive tone of the text without tipping over into what could be&#x2014;in the hands of a less skilled poet and artist&#x2014;overwhelming or obnoxious in its fervor. Instead, readers will appreciate and immediately recognize the joyful expectancy. VERDICT Buoyant and perfectly childlike, meant to be read aloud with gusto and a keen sense of urgency.

So when American physician Sumner Jackson, who lived with his wife and young son Phillip at Number 11, found himself drawn into the Liberation network of the French resistance, he knew the stakes were impossibly high. Just down the road at Number 31 was the "mad sadist" Theodor Dannecker, an Eichmann prot�g� charged with deporting French Jews to concentration camps. And Number 84 housed the Parisian headquarters of the Gestapo, run by the most effective spy hunter in Nazi Germany. <br><br>From his office at the American Hospital, itself an epicenter of Allied and Axis intrigue, Jackson smuggled fallen Allied fighter pilots safely out of France, a job complicated by the hospital director's close ties to collaborationist Vichy. After witnessing the brutal round-up of his Jewish friends, Jackson invited Liberation to officially operate out of his home at Number 11&#x2014;but the noose soon began to tighten. When his secret life was discovered by his Nazi neighbors, he and his family were forced to undertake a journey into the dark heart of the war-torn continent from which there was little chance of return.<br><br>Drawing upon a wealth of primary source material and extensive interviews with Phillip Jackson, Alex Kershaw recreates the City of Light during its darkest days. The untold story of the Jackson family anchors the suspenseful narrative, and Kershaw dazzles readers with the vivid immediacy of the best spy thrillers. Awash with the tense atmosphere of World War II's Europe, <i>Avenue of Spies</i> introduces us to the brave doctor who risked everything to defy Hitler.</p><p>ALEX KERSHAW is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of several books on World War II, including <i>The Bedford Boys</i> and <i>The Longest Winter</i>.

Jewelry&#x2014;which has long served as a stand-in for wealth and power, glamor and success&#x2014;has birthed cultural movements, launched political dynasties, and started wars. Masterfully weaving together pop science and history, <em>Stoned</em> breaks history into three categories&#x2014;Want, Take, and Have&#x2014;and explains what the diamond on your finger has to do with the GI Bill, why green-tinted jewelry has been exalted by so many cultures, why the glass beads that bought Manhattan for the Dutch were initially considered a fair trade, and how the French Revolution started over a coveted necklace.</p><p>Studded with lively personalities and fascinating details, <em>Stoned</em> tells the remarkable story of our abiding desire for the rare and extraordinary.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2015:</strong> Most of us have probably heard the expression &#x201c;diamonds are a girl&#x2019;s best friend&#x201d; &#x2014; but have we ever asked ourselves why? Yes, they are sparkly and beautiful, but so is cubic zirconia at a fraction of the price. Indestructable? Yet another brilliant ad campaign has been telling us for years that &#x201c;diamonds are forever.&#x201d; But, in fact, at around 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit a diamond will literally vanish. So what is it really that makes a diamond, an emerald, a Faberg� egg, or even glass beads so desirable? In <em>Stoned</em>, Aja Raden sifts through the psychology, neuroscience, and mythos behind the human desire for beautiful things and why we treat some objects as more precious (and therefore valuable) than others. Lest you imagine this as some boring academic tome, fear not&#x2014;Raden&#x2019;s cheeky attitude and fascinating anecdotes about everything from Holland&#x2019;s Tulipomania to various jewel-encrusted royal scandals and dazzling legends make <em>Stoned</em> a treasure trove of fun narrative history. --<em>Seira Wilson</em></p><p>What makes a stone a jewel?

In this compelling narrative, the award-winning journalist Julia Flynn Siler chronicles how this Pacific kingdom, creation of a proud Polynesian people, was encountered, annexed, and absorbed." Kevin Starr, historian, University of Southern California<br><br>Around 200 A.D., intrepid Polynesians paddled thousands of miles across the Pacific and arrived at an undisturbed archipelago. For centuries, their descendants lived with almost no contact from the Western world but in 1778 their profound isolation was shattered with the arrival of Captain Cook. Deftly weaving together a memorable cast of characters, <i>Lost Kingdom</i> brings to life the ensuing clash between the vulnerable Polynesian people and the relentlessly expanding capitalist powers. Portraits of royalty, rogues, sugar barons, and missionaries combine into a sweeping tale of the Hawaiian kingdom&#x2019;s rise and fall.<br><br>At the center of the story is Lili uokalani, the last queen of Hawaii. Born in 1838, she lived through the nearly complete economic transformation of the islands. Lucrative sugar plantations owned almost exclusively by white planters, dubbed the "Sugar Kings," gradually subsumed the majority of the land. Hawaii became a prize in the contest between America, Britain, and France, each of whom were seeking to expand their military and commercial influence in the Pacific.<br><br><i>Lost Kingdom</i> is the tragic story of Lili uokalani&#x2019;s family and their fortunes. The monarchy had become a figurehead, victim to manipulation from the wealthy sugar-plantation owners. Upon ascending to the throne, Lili uokalani was determined to enact a constitution reinstating the monarchy&#x2019;s power but she was outmaneuvered and, in January 1893, U.S. Marines from the USS <i>Boston</i> marched through the streets of Honolulu to the palace. The annexation of Hawaii had begun, ushering in a new century of American imperialism.<br></p><p>Julia Flynn Siler is an award-winning journalist. Her book, <i>The House of Mondavi: The Rise and Fall of an American Wine Dynasty</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> best seller. She has written for <i>Business Week</i> and the <i>New York Times</i>, and is now a contributing writer for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> in San Francisco.The queen was back at the palace, just a few blocks from Honolulu Harbor, having been rebuffed two days earlier in her attempt to introduce a new constitution. Hearing the beat of the American military drums, she stepped onto the veranda and watched from above as the troops marched from the harbor. As they kicked up dust in the unpaved streets, she could see they were heavily weighed down with double belts of cartridges. The sun sank and the skies over Honolulu darkened. The blue-jacketed sailors approached the palace. <br><br>Beneath the town&#x2019;s newly installed electric streetlamps, Lili uokalani could see them pushing a revolving cannon and a fearsome Gatling gun that could rip through a large crowd. Following their movements in the streets, she felt fear. Why had the troops landed when everything seemed at peace? The air was heavy with the scent of gardenias. Mosquitoes were drawn to the sweat of the blue-jacketed sailors. As the troops marched past the palace grounds, accompanied by drum rolls, they hoisted their rifles to their shoulders and seemed to point them in the queen&#x2019;s direction. <br><br>Were their weapons drawn and ready to fire, as Lili uokalani later recalled? Or were they merely signaling their respect for Hawai i&#x2019;s queen by marching past and beating the drums in a royal salute, as one of their commanding officers later insisted? Whatever their intention, this brash display of military power ignited a crisis that would change the course of American history.<br></p><h2>Chinese Fairy Tales and Legends: A Gift Edition of 73 Enchanting Chinese Folk Stories and Fairy Tales</h2><p><p><b>An elegantly packaged new edition of a classic Chinese folk tale collection that responds to the contemporary fascination with the ancient culture of the Far East. </b></p><p>This elegantly presented edition of Richard Wilhelm &amp; Frederick H. Martens' classic collection of 73 Chinese fairy tales has been re-edited by a leading Chinese historian to heighten its appeal to the modern Western reader. As China continues to develop as an economic and political superpower, there has been a growing interest in its history and literature. China has a rich oral tradition and these stories, passed down through hundreds of years, not only enthrall and delight, but also cast light on the country's ancient culture.</p><p>Chinese folklore is as colourful and captivating as the <i>Arabian Nights</i> or the work of the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen, yet the stories themselves remain largely undiscovered in the West. Written with economy and wit, the short, one- or two-page tales exhibit those distinct aspects of the Chinese character and approach to life which derive from the values of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. These include moderation, the value of promises, respect for one's elders, justice and injustice, and the power of wisdom.</p><p>The stories are arranged thematically under headings such as nursery fairy tales, nature and animal tales, and myths. Some, such as the legend of the ghostly general and haunted battlefield, engage with the supernatural, while others are dramatic tales featuring flying ogres and cunning demons. Yet others introduce magical talking animals, dragons, endangered princesses, clever shepherd boys and divine figures, including the shape-shifting Yang Oerlang, Guan Yu, the god of war, and the Silkworm Goddess who has a horse's head.</p><p>Intriguing titles such as <i>Why Dog and Cat Are Enemies</i>, <i>The Dragon Princess</i>, <i>The Maiden Who Was Stolen Away</i> and <i>The Bird with Nine Heads</i> sit next to tales familiar to all Chinese children, including <i>The Lady of the Moon </i>and <i>The Herd Boy and the Weaving Maiden.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Dr Richard Wilhelm</b> (10 May 1873 &#x2013; 2 March 1930) was a German sinologist, theologian, and missionary.

The Grass Clippers are the first to score, the Meat the first to steal and block. The crowd cheers as the points increase. Triceratops scores an easy deuce for the Clippers, and Raptor scores for the Meat with a slam dunk. Teamwork is demonstrated with an 'alley-oop' by T. rex and Raptor and an assist by Apatosaurus. When Stego and Pterodactyl collide on the court, the Dodo referee blows his whistle to call a foul. During halftime, the players disappear off the page, but readers will be entertained by a show that features cheerleaders, mascots, and an Elvis impersonator. After halftime, Jobaria (who was on the bench) works hard to tie up the game. Both coed teams have talented players of all shapes and sizes. Rhyming couplets contain basketball terminology and a mention of the next book in this dinosaur-centric series, <em>Dino-Football</em>. Although there is a lot of action on the court, this game is easy to follow. Visible lines allow readers to see the path of the ball, and colored text helps to identify players and teams. <strong>The commentary is fast paced and exciting, the illustrations highlight basketball tradition and culture (cutting down the net, an audience showing team spirit), and the end is inspiring.</strong>" --<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The team that brought us <em>Dino-Baseball</em>, <em>-Soccer</em> and <em>-Hockey</em> (2010, 2009, 2007) this time delivers nothing but net. Once again divided by food preference, the Grassclippers take on the Meat, pitting some of the better-known dinosaurs against each other in a high-stakes game for the championship trophy. Wheeler's staccato rhyming verse mimics both the play-by-play announcement and the action of a basketball game, making readers feel a part of the excitement. 'Allo answers off the dribble. / Diplo takes it up the middle&#x2015; / &#x2015;T. rex charges from behind. / Steals the ball. It's Meaty time!' (Dino and team names are in bold and color-coded: red for carnivores, green for herbivores.) The off-court goings-on are just as accurately portrayed&#x2015;cheerleaders, agitated coaches, famous spectators and some typical half-time events. <strong>Gott's vividly colored illustrations are filled with energy&#x2015;almost like sitting courtside.</strong> And just as in real life, observers may lose track of who's who in the melee, especially if they are not up on their species. Gott does a very good job of matching his artwork to the text, making it relatively easy for those unfamiliar with basketball to guess what 'free throw,' 'dunk' and 'taking it to the hole' might mean. Still, this is not a basketball primer. <strong>Likely to be a slam dunk with both basketball and dinosaur fans...and football enthusiasts can look forward to the teams' next match.</strong>" --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Continuing their sports rivalry (<em>Dino-Baseball</em>, <em>Dino-Hockey</em>), the plant-eating dinosaurs and their carnivorous counterparts meet in a championship basketball game.

Thai cuisine is more popular today than ever, yet there is no book that chronicles the real food that Thai people eat every day&#x2014;until now.</p><p>&nbsp;In <i>Bangkok</i>, award-winning author Leela Punyaratabandhu offers 120 recipes that capture the true spirit of the city&#x2014;from heirloom family dishes to restaurant classics to everyday street eats to modern cosmopolitan fare. Beautiful food and location photography will make this a must-have keepsake for any reader who has fallen under Bangkok&#x2019;s spell.</p></p><p><b>Leela Punyaratabandhu</b> is the author of the award-winning&nbsp;cooking blog She Simmers and the book <i>Simple Thai Food</i>. Her writing has&nbsp;appeared on CNN Travel&nbsp;and the food website Serious Eats. Dividing her time between&nbsp;Chicago and Bangkok, Punyaratabandhu writes about Thai food and Thai&nbsp;restaurants both in the United States and Thailand.THE FOOD OF BANGKOK<br><br>As the capital, Bangkok is naturally the first city that comes to mind when people think of Thailand, and as the center of government, Bangkok does represent the entire country. But culturally and culinarily, the city cannot be considered representative of any other place but itself&#x2014;not even the Central region of which it is part. In other words, Bangkok is unique, and so is its food.&nbsp;<br><br> Two key factors have shaped the food of Bangkok, the first of which is geography. Because the Chao Phraya River runs through the city&#x2019;s heart en route to emptying into the Gulf of Thailand, freshwater fish and river prawns feature prominently in the city&#x2019;s culinary tradition. Take fish and prawns out of the traditional cuisine of Bangkok and a great chasm would open. Their popularity is due in part to their abundance. But the archaic religious belief that frowns on the killing of larger animals, such as water buffaloes or cows, because they are useful in rice farming and therefore deserve our gratitude and protection, has also contributed to the dominance of aquatic animals. In adherence with that principle, the ancient inhabitants of the alluvial plain of the Chao Phraya subsisted on a simple regimen of rice, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Although by the time Bangkok was founded, pigs, chickens, and ducks had already been incorporated into the diet, and nowadays even though Bangkokians have no qualms about downing a bowl of beef noodles, the remnants of that river-dependent way of life and cooking can still be seen.&nbsp;<br><br> History has been an equally important factor in defining the city&#x2019;s food. Bangkok has always been influenced by foreign cultures through both visitors and settlers, and they have shaped its cuisine at every level, from the royal courts to the grassroots.&nbsp;<br><br> The origin of Bangkok traces back to a settlement on the west side of the river that was under the control of the ruling Ayutthaya Kingdom (1357&#x2013;1767) whose center was located some fifty miles north of&nbsp;contemporary Bangkok. Although small, the village, due to its strategic location on the river, steadily grew in significance as an important customs outpost. That meant that even then Bangkok was exposed to European, Persian, Chinese, and Japanese influences, as well as to groups that had already established their presence in Ayutthaya, such as the Mon, an ethnic group originally from the Mon State in Burma (Myanmar). Ayutthaya was destroyed in 1767, and the Thonburi Kingdom was established the following year. With the change in rulers, the center of government and trade moved to Thonburi, an area on the west bank of the Chao Phraya that is now part of present-day Bangkok. The kingdom ended after a fairly short run, however, and in 1782, Rama I, the first king of the new ruling dynasty, the House of Chakri, established the Rattanakosin Kingdom on the east bank of the river, and with it, the center of power known as Krungthep Maha Nakhon by the Thais and as Bangkok outside of Thailand. The capital&#x2014;and the economy&#x2014;grew steadily through burgeoning international trade and thoughtful modernization into a stunning, vibrant, diverse city on both sides of the river.&nbsp;<br><br> Today, Bangkok cuisine can be described as an indigenous Central cuisine with heavy influences from a heady blend of foreign cultures&#x2014;Chinese, Mon, Persian, Portuguese, modern European, North American, and more&#x2014;resulting in a beautiful, quirky mix that locals and visitors alike can&#x2019;t get enough of.<br><br>&nbsp;<b>Red curry paste&nbsp;</b><br><b>NAM PHRIK KAENG PHET&nbsp;</b><br><br>This paste is the base for the classic Thai curry that has come to be known internationally as &#x201c;red curry&#x201d; due to its reddish color. This so-called Red Curry is, of course, just one among the countless other types of Thai curries, many of which sport the same color. However, <i>kaeng phet </i>happens to be one of the most common and the most popular type of curry in Bangkok; its paste base is also one of the most versatile which can be used to flavor several non-curry dishes.

Start the tale from the beginning in the book that inspired the feature film <i>The Vampire's Assistant </i>and petrified devoted fans worldwide.</b><br>A young boy named Darren Shan and his best friend, Steve, get tickets to the Cirque Du Freak, a wonderfully gothic freak show featuring weird, frightening half human/half animals who interact terrifyingly with the audience. In the midst of the excitement, true terror raises its head when Steve recognizes that one of the performers-- Mr. Crepsley-- is a vampire! <br><br>Stever remains after the show finishes to confront the vampire-- but his motives are surprising! In the shadows of a crumbling theater, a horrified Darren eavesdrops on his friend and the vampire, and is witness to a monstrous, disturbing plea. As if by destiny, Darren is pulled to Mr. Crepsley and what follows is his horrifying descent into the dark and bloody world of vampires. <br><br>This is the beginning of Darren's story. <br></p><p>Anyone who loves the humorous but hair-raising horror in R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series will devour British author Darren Shan's first novel with equal zeal. Some books are born with a surrounding buzz; this one even has Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's stamp of approval: "Fast-paced and compelling, full of satisfying macabre touches," she writes. Warner Brothers will be making it into a movie, and the rest of the series is already in the works. Given all that, you'd expect a tour de force! Really, though, <i>Cirque Du Freak</i> is a thrill ride that will keep even the most reluctant readers turning pages, but will never take its place in the literary canon.<p> Darren Shan, author and narrator, sets the book up as a true story, warning readers: "Real life's nasty. It's cruel.... Evil often wins." Indeed, evil begins to win when Darren and his buddies find a flier for "Cirque Du Freak," a traveling freak show promising performances by the snake-boy, the wolf-man, and Larten Crepsley and his giant spider, Madame Octa. Darren and his friend Steve wouldn't miss it for the world.</p><p> So, Saturday night they sneak out to the old theater, tall and dark, with broken windows. "Every act you see tonight is real," croaks Mr. Tall. "Each performer is unique. And none are harmless." That's for sure. (A werewolf bites off the hand of someone in the audience, for instance.) Things grow very serious for the two boys when Steve not only recognizes Mr. Crepsley as a famous vampire, but professes his true desire to join him! To make matters worse, the spider-obsessed Darren goes back to the old theater to steal Madame Octa so he can teach her tricks in his room. (He does, with mixed results.) The plot further coagulates as Darren is faced with some terrible decisions about what to do to save his bloodthirsty friend Steve.</p><p> Readers may be too enthralled to notice some clumsy editing (the aforementioned bitten-off hand is later referred to as an arm, Darren stops dead in his tracks when he's already stopped, etc.). They may also not notice that the boys constantly use adult-sounding expressions like "his breath stank to the high heavens," though the book is clearly set in the 21st century. If this book gets under your kids' skin (and it probably will), they're in luck--we haven't heard the last of the Saga of Darren Shan. (Ages 10 and older, not for the faint of heart) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Darren Shan is the New York Times bestselling author of Cirque Du Freak and The Demonata, whose novels have sold over 15 million copies worldwide.

In his restaurant, he calls out the names of the cooks--Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, and others&#x2014;who have inspired him, and in his book, he teaches you how to work with those flavors and cultures with respect and creativity.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Houston&#x2019;s culinary reputation as a steakhouse town was put to rest by Chris Shepherd, the Robb Report&#x2019;s Best Chef of the Year. A cook with insatiable curiosity, he&#x2019;s trained not just in fine-dining restaurants but in Houston&#x2019;s Korean grocery stores, Vietnamese noodle shops, Indian kitchens, and Chinese mom-and-pops. His food, incorporating elements of all these cuisines, tells the story of the city, and country, in which he lives. An advocate, not an appropriator, he asks his diners to go and visit the restaurants that have inspired him, and in this book he brings us along to meet, learn from, and cook with the people who have taught him.&nbsp;<br><br>The recipes include signatures from his restaurant&#x2014;favorites such as braised goat with Korean rice dumplings, or fried vegetables with caramelized fish sauce. The lessons go deeper than recipes: the book is about how to understand the pantries of different cuisines, how to taste and use these flavors in your own cooking. Organized around key ingredients like soy, dry spices, or chiles, the chapters function as master classes in using these seasonings to bring new flavors into your cooking and new life to flavors you already knew. But even beyond flavors and techniques, the book is about a bigger story: how Chris, a son of Oklahoma who looks like a football coach, came to be &#x201c;adopted&#x201d; by these immigrant cooks and families, how he learned to connect and share and truly cross cultures with a sense of generosity and respect, and how we can all learn to make not just better cooking, but a better community, one meal at a time.</p><p>Midwest-raised chef&nbsp;<b>Chris Shepherd</b>&nbsp;opened Underbelly, featuring locally sourced food inspired by the ethnic diversity of Houston, in March 2012.

To me, &#x201c;local&#x201d; is just as much about the people who live in my community, the people who inspire me and teach me and work with me, and how they like to cook and eat.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m lucky to live in Houston, Texas, which&#x2014;this may surprise you&#x2014;is by some measures the country&#x2019;s most racially and ethnically diverse metropolis. In fact, the last census showed that there is no longer a &#x201c;majority&#x201d; in Houston. It&#x2019;s a city of minorities. So for me, thinking about what it means to cook locally in Houston means going out into the different neighborhoods of my city and taking a census of my own: one of flavors, and of culinary traditions. I meet my fellow Houstonians, eat with them, learn how they cook, and then let those experiences inform my cooking. I try to tell stories through my food, stories that represent and reflect where we live.&nbsp;<br><br>Most of my favorite things to cook, many of which appear on the menus of my restaurants, are not dishes I grew up with. I wasn&#x2019;t exposed to b�nh m� or tamales until later in life. I grew up in a white middle-class family in Nebraska and Oklahoma, where food was always important. The dishes that my mom cooked fit easily into what is broadly considered (Anglo) &#x201c;American food&#x201d;: meatloaf and&nbsp;mashed potatoes, green beans stewed with pork, zucchini bread. To this day, I carry a torch for these dishes, and they are still a part of my cooking.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was in culinary school, and then a line cook coming up through the ranks, the ingredients and techniques that I had access to were pulled from Eurocentric cultures and cuisines. French food still held the crown as the &#x201c;most important and best&#x201d; cuisine in most cooking schools, and high-end restaurants at the time focused on versions of that same set of dishes. There were small cracks in the firmament, though, ones that piqued my curiosity. As a dishwasher at a sushi restaurant, I had my first taste of Japanese curry, served with scrambled eggs and rice, as a staff meal. I tried to understand the flavors at play in my orders of General Tso&#x2019;s chicken.&nbsp;<br><br>Then I moved to Houston.&nbsp;<br><br>Working alongside Mexican-American line cooks, I learned about chiles&#x2014;how to gauge their heat, how to use dried chiles versus fresh ones. And the late-night spot we all went to after work was a Vietnamese place where I had my first taste of fish sauce. At some point, I began to realize that my cooking, which was still drawing mostly from my culinary school and restaurant training, was happening in a vacuum and didn&#x2019;t reflect the food that surrounded me. And I wanted to get out of that vacuum.<br><br>It started as simple curiosity. A friend would mention a great pho shop, and I&#x2019;d go, order the first bowl listed on the menu, eat it, and leave. I got into it. I tracked down tips on new shops, and I explored their menus. Pretty quickly, these became the dishes I craved, dishes that became essential to my understanding of the place where I live. And I admit, my first instinct was to be proud of myself for &#x201c;discovering&#x201d; these spots&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the guy with a bead on the best pho in Houston.&#x201d; But I realized that there&#x2019;s a distinction between &#x201c;discovering&#x201d; and <i>learning</i>. Reality check: I wasn&#x2019;t &#x201c;discovering&#x201d; anything because these communities and restaurants had been thriving long before I ever showed up. And when I <i>did</i> go, and showed that I was there out of respect, curiosity, and a desire to learn, eating in restaurants became something more, something better: It was about making relationships. The food became more than delicious. It came to be about stories and the context of the people who were making these dishes, and their friendship and trust in letting me share their stories.&nbsp;<br><br>So I started going out as much as I could manage, and I started asking a lot of questions.&nbsp;<br><br>On a typical day off, I&#x2019;d get in the car with a few friends and drive toward Bellaire, a sprawling neighborhood in Southwest Houston that has the highest concentration&nbsp;of Vietnamese businesses in the city. Or I&#x2019;d head west, to H Mart, the giant Korean grocery store. Or north, to the Mexican restaurant El Hidalguense that roasts whole goats on spits in the dining room. And we&#x2019;d eat. I&#x2019;d start conversations with the servers, the cooks, the bussers, and the owners; we&#x2019;d talk about Houston, how they arrived here, what they miss about the place they left. But the conversations always started with the food. I&#x2019;d come back on another day, and we&#x2019;d keep talking. Conversations about spices or the proper way to make a sauce opened the gate for more personal exchanges, ones that, in many cases, led to great friendships. More often than not, I&#x2019;ve ended up in the kitchens of these restaurants, learning at the sides of these strangers who have become neighbors and friends. And they&#x2019;ve ended up in the kitchens of my restaurants, or in our dining rooms for dinner.<br><br>These people have become my mentors, and Houston has proved to be the best culinary school I could ever hope to have.&nbsp;<br><br>So now I&#x2019;m writing this book to share some of the recipes that have been inspired by these experiences and connections, but also to encourage others to do the same. Reframe your idea of what your local food is by including the food of the people who live nearby, especially the people who may not look or sound like you.&nbsp;<br><br>Because here&#x2019;s the thing: Houston&#x2019;s diversity is not unique. Every city, and nearly every town, has its share of immigrant and cultural communities. Usually, they&#x2019;re concentrated in specific neighborhoods. The food traditions of these communities are often kept within these neighborhoods as well, at a distance. They remain outliers, the food relegated to an &#x201c;international&#x201d; or &#x201c;ethnic&#x201d; label rather than viewed as what they are&#x2014;as part of a regional cuisine.&nbsp;<br><br>And it&#x2019;s not just restaurants but also ingredients. In chain supermarkets, there&#x2019;s usually an &#x201c;international&#x201d; section, part of an aisle that has some Asian sauces, rice products, ready-to-eat curries, and seasonings. These are all grouped together, a whitewashed, Epcot-like pantry. To be fair, it&#x2019;s getting better&#x2014;these sections are growing slowly. But most immigrant neighborhoods have specialty grocery stores and markets where the ingredients to make their staple dishes aren&#x2019;t ghetto-ized. I encourage you to expand your shopping options as well as your cooking horizons.<br><br>It&#x2019;s time to address this blind spot in the world of restaurant chefs and glossy cookbooks. As a food-loving society, we&#x2019;ve rediscovered the magic of eating and cooking based on what&#x2019;s in season, so now it&#x2019;s time to go a step further. Local food should reflect the people of a place, just as much as the ingredients of a place. Our eating experiences will be better for it, not to mention our empathy and understanding for those who are different from us.&nbsp;<br><br>It starts with a willingness to explore your surroundings. We&#x2019;ll share the stories of some of the people who have influenced me and offer an approach to pushing past our culinary comfort zones.&nbsp;<br><br>This book is also about how to incorporate the techniques and ingredients from a spectrum of immigrant influences into your cooking rotation.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#x2019;ll use ingredients as our entry point. This book is organized around pantry staples and seasonings, simple things that provide the flavor bases or foundations of whole cuisines. They all have long histories (some of them ancient), and their evolutions parallel the major migrations of human beings over centuries. They are also ingredients that aren&#x2019;t necessarily featured in Anglo-American food traditions.<br><br>Each ingredient is a gateway to the stories, cooking styles, and relationships that have inspired my recipes.<br><br>Of course, I hope that by reading and cooking through each of these chapters, you&#x2019;ll walk away with the tools and techniques to make things like corn, spices, and fish sauce sing in your kitchen. But I also hope you&#x2019;ll leave with a hunger to head out on your own and fill your own pantry with ingredients you didn&#x2019;t know you needed . . . but soon won&#x2019;t want to live without.</p><h2>Mrs. McGinty&#39;s Dead: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries, 28)</h2><p><p><strong>In <em>Mrs. McGinty&#x2019;s Dead</em>, one of Agatha Christie&#x2019;s most ingenious mysteries, the intrepid Hercule Poirot must look into the case of a brutally murdered landlady.</strong></p><p>Mrs. McGinty died from a brutal blow to the back of her head.

Of course we probably won&#x2019;t, and if you read Robert Kurson&#x2019;s <em>Pirate Hunters: Treasure, Obsession, and the Search for a Legendary Pirate Ship</em>, it will be clear why. It&#x2019;s hard work, and treasure hunters are special people. Kurson&#x2019;s book tells the story of John Chatterton and John Mattera, two longtime treasure hunters who get a tip from another veteran about a pirate ship that went down off the Dominican Republic in the 1600s. There&#x2019;s much to endure in their search&#x2014;dangerous dives, scouring charts and maps, debt, and encounters with a few modern pirate types&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s only after they themselves start thinking like a pirate that they make the progress they&#x2019;re looking for. A fun, quick, informative read that will have you dreaming of what you could do if only you set your mind to it. <em>&#x2013; Chris Schluep</em></p><b>Robert Kurson</b> is the author of the runaway bestseller <i>Shadow Divers,</i> and <i>Crashing Through</i>.</p><h2>Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns</h2><p>With brand-new scenes, <i>The New York Times </i>bestseller and sequel you&#x2019;ve been waiting for&#x2014;the follow-up to the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>!<br><br>Almost a decade has passed since Andy Sachs quit the job &#x201c;a million girls would die for&#x201d; working for Miranda Priestly at <i>Runway</i> magazine&#x2014;a dream that turned out to be a nightmare.

Without the only person who ever looked at his magic as a gift instead of a threat, Loki slips further into anguish and the shadow of his universally adored brother, Thor. <br>When Asgardian magic is detected in relation to a string of mysterious murders on Earth, Odin sends Loki to investigate.

These powerful tools go far in helping clients connect with their values and give them the motivation needed to make a real, conscious commitment to change. Unfortunately, many of the metaphors that clinicians use have become stale and ineffective. That&#x2019;s why you need fresh, <em>new</em> resources for your professional library.</p>In this breakthrough book, two ACT researchers provide an essential A-Z resource guide that includes tons of new metaphors and experiential exercises to help promote client acceptance, defusion from troubling thoughts, and values-based action. The book also includes scripts tailored to different client populations, and special metaphors and exercises that address unique problems that may sometimes arise in your therapy sessions.<br><p>Several ACT texts and workbooks have been published for the treatment of a variety of psychological problems. However, no one resource exists where you can find an exhaustive list of metaphors and experiential exercises geared toward the six core elements of ACT.&nbsp;Whether you are treating a client with anxiety, depression, trauma, or an eating disorder, this book will provide you with the skills needed to improve lives, one exercise at a time.</p>With a special foreword by ACT cofounder Steven C.

With its premise that human suffering is an unfortunate byproduct of our everyday language and conceptions, metaphors become a more important tool in this therapeutic approach than most others. Now, Jill A. Stoddard, and Niloofar Afari have assembled these metaphors in an entertaining reference book that will be extraordinarily valuable&#x2015;not only to practitioners of ACT, but to psychotherapists everywhere.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David H.

This book will certainly satisfy that appetite for those looking for new ways to best connect with their clients. But more importantly, this book will inspire readers to recognize what has been true all along: that the metaphors and exercises that will be most useful are those that draw upon clients&#x2019; own experiences. By bringing this compendium together, the authors will inspire clinicians around the world to be more creative in their practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sonja V.

If you are looking for new, distinctive, and effective ways to deepen your clients&#x2019; understanding of ACT, your quest is at an end. Stoddard and Afari have pulled together a wonderful compendium of rich and effective metaphors that, when delivered in therapy, will create an engaging and meaningful experience. The wealth and variety of stories and exercises will meet the needs of many a client.

Fortunes boom and bust, empires wax and wane, and change&#x2015;whether social, political, or technological&#x2015;has its winners, its losers, its advocates, and its enemies. Through all the turbulent passage of time, graphic design&#x2015;with its vivid, neat synthesis of image and idea&#x2015;has distilled the spirit of each age.</p><p>This book is an in-depth history of graphic design from the end of the 19th century to the &#x2019;50s. It traces the evolution of this creative field from its beginning as poster design to its further development into advertising, corporate identity, packaging, and editorial design. Organized chronologically, the volume features over 2,500 seminal designs from all over the world, 71 of which are profiled in detail besides 61 leaders in the field, including Alphonse Mucha (chocolate advertisements), Edward Johnston (London Underground logo and typeface), El Lissitzky (constructivist graphics), Herbert Matter (photomontage travel posters from Switzerland), Saul Bass (animated opening titles), and A. M. Cassandre (art deco posters).</p><p>With his sweeping knowledge of the field, author Jens M�ller curates the standout designs for each year alongside a running sequence of design milestones. Meanwhile, in his introductory essay, David Jury situates graphic design from its point of origin in early printing, engraving, and lithography to striking creative developments in the 19th century. Each consecutive decade is then prefaced by a succinct overview as well as a stunning visual timeline, offering a vivid display of the variety of graphic production in each decade as well as the global landscape which it at once described and defined.</p><p>As we move on from and reflect upon the 20th century, this first volume examines the foundations of what would influence some of the fastest-changing creative fields. Combined with Volume Two&#x2015;which spans from the 1960s until today&#x2015;the tomes offer the most comprehensive exploration of graphic design to date and a long-overdue recognition of its enormous contribution to economics, politics, social causes, the arts, media, and the way we see the world.</p></p><p>Jens M�ller was born in Koblenz, Germany, in 1982 and studied graphic design. Recipient of numerous national and international design awards, M�ller is Creative Director of optik design studio in D�sseldorf, editor of the A5 book series on graphic design history, and author of Logo Modernism. He is a visiting lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences in D�sseldorf and currently holds a temporary professorship in the design department of the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences.&#x201c;This book, which looks at the legacy and heritage of graphic design, is an essential portal to our appreciation of the world&#x2019;s history.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: How Risk Taking Transforms Us, Body and Mind</h2><p><b>A successful Wall Street trader turned neuroscientist reveals how risk taking and stress transform our body chemistry</b><br><br>Before he became a world-class scientist, John Coates ran a derivatives trading desk in New York City. He used the expression &#x201c;the hour between dog and wolf&#x201d; to refer to the moment of Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation traders passed through when under pressure. They became cocky and irrationally risk-seeking when on a winning streak, tentative and risk-averse when cowering from losses. In a series of groundbreaking experiments, Coates identified a feedback loop between testosterone and success&#x2014;one that can cloud men&#x2019;s judgment in high-pressure decision-making. Coates demonstrates how our bodies produce the fabled gut feelings we so often rely on, how stress in the workplace can impair our judgment and even damage our health, and how sports science can help us toughen our bodies against the ravages of stress. Revealing the biology behind bubbles and crashes, <i>The Hour Between Dog and Wolf </i>sheds new and surprising light on issues that affect us all.</p><p><b>John Coates</b> is a senior research fellow in neuroscience and finance at the University of Cambridge.

She thought everything was behind her as that person was convicted and is behind bars. But one peaceful morning, Jane stumbles over a dead body while taking out the trash. The dead woman ran a nearby bed and breakfast and had been threatened by Jane's thriving new business and had even filed suit the previous week to try and shut her down.

It cools you off when it&#39;s hot and is too delicious to resist even in cold weather. How did it get to be so scrumptious? Best-selling author/illustrator Gail Gibbons dishes out the latest scoop on ice cream production. Ice cream has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a mixture of snow, milk, and rice. Gail Gibbons details the many firsts in ice cream history, from the earliest ice cream crank to the original waffle cone. Children&#39;s mouths will be watering as they follow ice cream&#39;s journey from farm to factory to freezer.</p><p>Gail Gibbons &#34;has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator,&#34; according to the Washington Post. Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.K-Gr. 2. In cheerful watercolors and a lucid text, Gibbons delivers the scoop on ice cream history, ingredients, innovations, and the mechanics of its small- and large-scale production. Labels, captions, and occasional cross-sectional images (a hand-cranked ice cream maker, a giant mixing vat) pack the artwork with as much information as the text itself. A step-by-step tour of an ice cream factory occupies the bulk of the book and will probably interest readers the most, even if Gibbons' honest reporting about the manufacturing process (such as the inclusion of stabilizers and emulsifiers) takes some of the romance out of her subject matter. Trivia concludes ("More ice cream is sold on Sunday than any day of the week"), along with the caveat "DON'T EAT TOO MUCH!"--a well-intentioned but probably ineffectual warning in a book that pretty much guarantees instant cravings for a fudge-drenched sundae. Adding to the author-illustrator's reliable oeuvre of informational picture books, this will provide solid support for ice cream-themed field trips or classroom projects. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But then it died beneath the weight of a particularly egotistical and bombastic owner&#x2014;a New York businessman named Donald J. Trump.

Baby eats one and puts five in the basket, but Mama doesn&#x2019;t notice. As Mama and Baby wend their way through the stalls, cheeky Baby collects five oranges, four biscuits, three ears of sweet corn, two pieces of coconut . . . until Mama notices that her basket is getting very heavy! Poor Baby, she thinks, he must be very hungry by now! Rhythmic language, visual humor, and a bounty of delectable food make this a tale that is sure to whet little appetites for story time.</p><p><b>Atinuke</b> is a Nigerian-born author who started her career doing traditional oral storytelling. Her books include a <i>Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book </i>Honor Winner, a Notable Book for a Global Society, a Cybils Award Winner, and an Africana Award Winner. She lives in Wales. <br><br><b>Angela Brooksbank</b> worked as a designer and art director in children&#x2019;s book publishing before turning her hand to her own illustration. <i>Baby Goes to Market</i> is her debut picture book. She lives in London.Toddler-PreS&#x2014;A joyful black baby and his mother go shopping in an open air market in West Africa, where unbeknownst to Mama, baby is busy collecting his own wares from a variety of vendors. The rhythmic text is perfectly suited for reading aloud, and young listeners will quickly pick up on the inside joke between author and listeners as the illustrations feature the mischievious baby on Mama's back, adding his own items to the wide brimmed basket balanced atop her head. "Market is very crowded. Baby is very curious. Baby is so curious that Mrs. Ade, the banana seller, gives Baby six bananas. Baby is so surprised. Baby eats one banana...and puts five bananas in the basket." The pattern of Mama shopping for her own goods and adding them to the basket, and Baby being given treats to snack on and store in Mama's basket, turns the story into a clever count along. Brooksbank's debut as illustrator is strong. The vibrant marketplace is filled with color, texture, and patterns created using a mixed-media palette. The opening and ending endpapers feature the same pattern that is on the wrap Mama uses to hold Baby on her back. VERDICT Young listeners will delight in getting to know Baby and his Mama as they shop throughout the market. Consider for first purchase in larger collections.&#x2014;Lisa Kropp, Lindenhurst Memorial Library, NY</p><h2>The Irresistible Revolution, Updated and Expanded: Living as an Ordinary Radical</h2><p><p>In this updated 10th Anniversary Edition of <em>Irresistible Revolution</em>, Shane Claiborne uses unconventional examples from his own life to stir up questions about the church and the world, while challenging readers to truly live out their&nbsp;Christian faith.

Drawing on cutting edge research and his own experiences as a doctor, he argues that the secret to preventing disease and achieving wellness revolves around four critical pillars: food, relaxation, sleep, and movement. By making small, incremental changes in each of these key areas, you can create and maintain good health&#x2014;and alleviate and prevent illness. As Dr. Chatterjee, reveals we can reverse and make disease disappear without a complete overhaul of our lifestyle.</p><p>His dynamic, user-friendly approach is not about excelling at any one pillar. What matters is balance in every area of your life, which includes:</p><ul><li>Me-time every day</li><li>An electronic-free Sabbath once a week</li><li>Retraining your taste buds</li><li>Daily micro-fasts</li><li>Movement snacking</li><li>A bedtime routine</li></ul><p>Practical and life-changing, <em>How to Make Disease Disappear</em> is an inspiring and easy-to-follow guide to better health and happiness.</p></p><p><p><strong>In <em>How to Make Disease Disappear, </em>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee presents a radically simple plan for taking control of your health and your life.</strong></p><p>Chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and dementia are today the nation&#x2019;s leading causes of death and disability. Half of all American adults currently suffer with a chronic disease, with one in four people suffering from two or more. Despite the statistics, so much confusion exists about what we can do to protect ourselves and live long, healthy lives.</p><p>Acclaimed functional medicine doctor Rangan Chatterjee writes, &#x201c;The good news is that I can make these diseases disappear. That&#x2019;s right. This probably sounds like an extraordinary claim, but the reason I can make them disappear is that they&#x2019;re an illusion. These diseases are not the inevitable result of aging. They are not simply our genetic fate or our destiny. We do not have to suffer needlessly. The truth is these diseases don&#x2019;t really exist, at least not in the way we think they do.&#x201d;</p><p>A life free of disease revolves around Dr. Chatterjee&#x2019;s four pillars: relaxation, food, sleep and movement. By making small, achievable changes in each of these key areas, you can create and maintain good health&#x2014;and, most importantly, avoid and reverse illness.</p><p>Based on cutting-edge research and fascinating case studies from real patients, <em>How to Make Disease Disappear</em> is a practical and revolutionary path to avoiding disease and embracing the health we all deserve.</p><p>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is a pioneer in the emerging field of progressive medicine and is changing the way we look at illness. He is known for finding the root cause of people&#x2019;s problems by taking a 360-degree approach to health, which was highlighted in his groundbreaking BBC One TV show, <em>Doctor in the House</em>. He regularly lectures on this subject at events and conferences around the world.</p></p><h2>Mosby&#39;s Textbook for Long-Term Care Nursing Assistants</h2><p><p>With its highly visual format, topical information, and easy-to-follow guidance, <b>Mosby's Textbook for Long-Term Care Nursing Assistants, 8th Edition</b> is the perfect resource to help you master the ins and outs of long-term care.

Some versions are called &#x2018;Study Bibles&#x2019; and include lengthy essays in the front of the volume. While The Little Rock Catholic Study Bible contains customary introductory information written by several well-know scripture scholars, it has placed explicit study information on the page where the specific reference is found. Such study material includes definitions of terms and ideas, information about various characters, archaeological findings, relevant Church teachings, hints for personal prayer, and links with liturgical celebration. Pictures, charts, and related lists are also strategically placed throughout.

Clear background information, explanations, and charts throughout its pages help make the Word of God palatable for modern readers. In addition, pictures of the holy sites, like seasoning, make Scripture more appealing; and prayer starters encourage savoring it.

He lives with his family in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>reS-Gr 2-This recording of David McPhail's Mole Music (Holt, 1999) brings the picture book to life. The production's classical music selections, coupled with true-to-life sound effects, embody the story and make for a full, rich listening experience. As squirrel eats an acorn above mole's burrow, we hear the joyous music of the Third Movement of Beethoven's "Pastorale." As the story continues, the elegant, haunting strains of "La Cremosa," from Mozart's Requiem, express mole's dissatisfaction with his life. Musical selections are identified on the cassette insert, and include works by Massenet, Brahms, and Beethoven; the Shaker hymn, "Simple Gifts"; and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." Crystal clear sound effects help depict the action. As mole checks the mail for his violin, a rain shower conveys his disappointment when he finds the mailbox empty. Birds chirp and flutter at his attempts to play the instrument. We even hear mole humming happily as he digs his tunnels. Horses whinny and stamp as mounted soldiers, awaiting an impending battle, hear mole's music and abandon warfare for a friendlier confrontation. Master storyteller, Jim Weiss, aptly narrates the text, giving it a slow, clear, emphatic reading. His precision timing allows the music and sound effects to enhance the story. Side one of the cassette offers page turning prompts. This book and cassette will make a handsome addition to school and public library collections.<p></p><p><i>Bonnie Bolton, Cleveland Public Library, OH</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>No More Culturally Irrelevant Teaching (Not This but That)</h2><p><p>Every child is a cultural being with a unique history and rich cultural practices; a member of communities in and outside of school.

Jack loves his father and is proud of him, but he knows a giant letter <i>L</i> for <i>loser</i> has just been branded on his forehead. To make matters worse, Jack, furious when the inevitable stream of ridicule begins, blindly crashes into his bucket-bearing dad in the hallway, unleashing laughter, clapping, and plenty of water all around. Jack's anger is now a firestorm, and as author Andrew Clements so vividly phrases it: "The sizzling chunks of Jack's burning rage stuck to his father--like gobs of well-chewed watermelon bubble gum."<p> Jack's fury manifests itself into the perfect crime--a carefully premeditated, 13-piece Bubblicious attack on an innocent music-room chair that results in a sticky, gooey, smelly web that only a janitor would have the skills to remove. The "sweet smell of victory" diffuses quickly, however, when Jack is condemned to after-school gum-removal duty for the next three weeks. Stickier still is how this is going to play out at home with his mom and dad.</p><p> The after-school hours Jack spends scraping gum off furniture prove to be eye-opening. He develops a scholarly interest in gum excavation, and has plenty of time to make a list of ways he is <i>not</i> like his dad the janitor. But one day--first in a forgotten underground tunnel and then on a long truck-ride home--he discovers that there is more to his good-hearted, strong, unassuming father than he had ever even thought to imagine. Clements, a former public-school teacher and author of the bestselling <i>Frindle</i> and <i>The Landry News</i>, has a knack for getting to the heart of things while keeping the story buoyant. Readers of all ages will think twice about what kind of people (outside of their parental or occupational roles) their own parents might be.

These images are awesome not just for their beauty alone, but because they suggest an order underlying their growth, a harmony existing in nature. What does it mean that such an order exists; how far does it extend? <br><br> <i>The Power of Limits </i> was inspired by those simple discoveries of harmony. The author went on to investigate and measure hundreds of patterns&#x2014;ancient and modern, minute and vast. His discovery, vividly illustrated here, is that certain proportions occur over and over again in all these forms. Patterns are also repeated in how things grow and are made&#x2014;by the dynamic union of opposites&#x2014;as demonstrated by the spirals that move in opposite directions in the growth of a plant. <br><br>The joining of unity and diversity in the discipline of proportional limitations creates forms that are beautiful to us because they embody the principles of the cosmic order of which we are a part; conversely, the limitlessness of that order is revealed by the strictness of its forms. The author shows how we, as humans, are included in the universal harmony of form, and suggests that the union of complementary opposites may be a way to extend that harmony to the psychological and social realms as well.</p><p>Gy�rgy Doczi practiced architecture in Hungary, Sweden, Iran, and the United States. He initiated a permanent exhibit on form in nature and art at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, and was a founder of the Friends of Jungian Psychology Northwest. He died in 1995."Those who read this book are in for a treat, for they may discover a new way of seeing the world, literally.

At 16 he was hustling tips at a Boston nightclub. In Harlem he was known as Detroit Red, a slick street operator. At 19 he was back in Boston, leading a gang of burglars. At 20 he was in prison.<br><br>It was in prison that Malcolm Little started the journey that would lead him to adopt the name Malcolm X, and there he developed his beliefs about what being black means in America: beliefs that shook America then, and still shake America today.<br><br>Few men in American history are as controversial or compelling as Malcolm X. In this Coretta Scott King Honor Book, Walter Dean Myers, winner of a Newbery Honor and four-time Coretta Scott King Award winner, portrays Malcolm X as prophet, dealer, convict, troublemaker, revolutionary, and voice of black militancy.</p><p>The late Walter Dean Myers was the 2012-2013 National Ambassador for Young People's Literature. He was the critically acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of an award-winning body of work which includes <i>Somewhere in the Darkness</i>, <i>Slam!</i>, and <i>Monster</i>. Mr. Myers has received two Newbery Honor medals, five Coretta Scott King Author Book Awards, and three National Book Award Finalist citations. In addition, he was the winner of the first Michael L.

The police officer looked at the men standing in ranks, and walked away. Malcolm sent one of the men into the hospital to check on the condition of Hinton.<br><br>The crowd behind the formation was growing more restless and more police were summoned. Soon there were two lines of men facing each other, one white, the other black. The policemen were not sure of what was happening. The men of the Nation of Islam were motionless.<br><br>The police official returned to Malcolm and told him that the crowd behind his formation was shouting at the police and acting in a manner that he could not tolerate.<br><br>Malcolm said that he would control the members of the Nation of Islam, and that the rest of the crowd was the problem of the police official. Again, the police official backed off.<br><br>The man that Malcolm had sent into the hospital returned. He told Malcolm the doctors had assured him that Hinton was getting the best care possible. Malcolm signaled the formation of men and they moved silently away.<br><br>That night and the next morning the community was filled with talk of &#x201c;the Muslims,&#x201d; and how they had confronted the police. The police talked about the incident as well and wondered exactly what challenge the Muslims presented to them and exactly who was this man who called himself Malcolm X.</p><h2>The First Day of Winter</h2><p><p><b>From renown picture book author Denise Fleming, a</b><b> cozy, cumulative book to warm a cold winter day</b></p><p>Alive with swirling snow and lots of outdoor fun, the first ten days of winter bring special gifts for a special friend. This cumulative tale will have children chanting along as they discover all the trimmings needed for the most perfect snowman ever!</p></p><p><p><b>Denise Fleming</b> has written and illustrated many children's books, including <i>In the Tall, Tall Grass</i>; <i>Shout! Shout It Out</i><i>!</i>; and <i>Sleepy, Oh So Sleepy</i>. She won a Caldecott Honor for <i>In the Small, Small Pond</i>. Denise published her first painting in the third grade, when she started taking classes at the Toledo Museum of Art and one of her paintings was chosen to be the cover of a teacher's magazine. She now works primarily with paper, by pouring colored paper pulp through hand-cut stencils. She lives in Toledo, Ohio.</p>PreSchool-K&#x2013;Told in a rhythm reminiscent of The Twelve Days of Christmas, a snowman's tale begins, On the first day of winter my best friend gave to me.../a red cap with a gold snap. The benefactor continues to deck out the snowman with two bright blue mittens for his stick hands; five birdseed pockets; nine big black buttons for his eyes, nose, and front; and, finally, 10 salty peanuts for his wintry toes. As in the holiday song, each time a new item is introduced, the story counts back to the first gift. Fleming captures the tranquility and light of snowy days with her unique artistic style. Her paper-pulp and stencil illustrations depict a winter wonderland in which vibrant striped scarves, blue mittens, and red hats provide the color in a white, uncluttered landscape. A squirrel, a mouse, a bird, a cat, a rabbit and a deer appear on each spread and seem to gaze at readers. The perspective shifts throughout the book, so on one page children look down on the snowman, while on others they look up at him from the ground. Readers finally see the snowman's friend, a bundled-up child, on the 10th day of winter. Quietly told and thoughtfully illustrated, Fleming's work celebrates the season and all of winter's creatures.<i>&#x2013;Shawn Brommer, South Central Library System, Madison, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the writer/historian you spend days if not weeks with each individual, researching their stories, getting under their skin. You really have the feeling that you are doing a kind of cosmic CPR,taking their original words and breathing new life in a readable format that places readers at the kitchen table with that person who had something important to say. The reader shares the intimate moments with them as he/she gets absorbed in a real story being told. As an interviewer it happened many times to me directly with our World War II veterans, in living rooms, kitchens and dining rooms all over 'Hometown USA', in the classroom, and at reunion'hospitality rooms' and hotel breakfast tables across America.&nbsp;<br><b>But memories are short.&nbsp;</b>A World War II memoirist once wrote, 'Ignorance and apathy are the greatest dangers to freedom.' I agree, but as a lifelong history teacher, I contend that it begins with people simply not being exposed to the history to begin with. For how could one not be drawn into these stories, the human drama, the interaction and the emotion that goes into putting an ideal first? After sitting at their table, how could you not give weight to what they have seen, and where they think we are going, as a people, as a nation?&nbsp;I saw this spark kindled time and again in my classroom, when we got to hear from real people who had a front row seat, who acted in the greatest drama in the history of the world.&nbsp;<br>Perhaps now I ramble. Now it is better to have them tell you themselves, about the world they grew up in, the challenges and obstacles placed on life's course, and how a generation of Americans not only rose to the challenge, but built the country and the freedoms that we enjoy today. They truly saved the world. Be inspired. Share their stories; give them voice. Lest we forget.MATTHEW ROZELL is an award-winning history teacher, author, blogger and speaker.

We often stay stuck with the level of confidence we have because we regard being confident as a matter of good luck. In fact, the opposite is true: confidence is a skill based on ideas about our place in the world, and its secrets can be learned.<b>The School of Life&nbsp;</b>is a global organisation helping people lead more fulfilled lives.

She passed away in December 2017.<b>1</b> <p>LIZA<br> Saturday, July 4, 1953</p> <p> When Liza Mellincamp thinks about the last time she ever saw Violet Sullivan, what comes most vividly to mind is the color of Violet's Japanese silk kimono, a shade of blue that Liza later learned was called "cerulean," a word that wasn't even in her vocabulary when she was fourteen years old. A dragon was embroidered in satin-stitch across the back, its strange dog-shaped face and arched body picked out in lime green and orange. Flames twisted from the dragon's mouth in curling ribbons of blood red.</p> <p> That last night, she'd arrived at the Sullivans' house at 6:00. Violet was going out at 6:15 and, as usual, she wasn't dressed and hadn't done her hair. The front door was open and as Liza approached, Baby, Violet's three-month-old buff-colored Pomeranian, started yapping in a shrill little doggy voice while she pawed at the screen, punching holes here and there. She had tiny black eyes and a black button nose and a small pink bow affixed to her forehead with stickum of some kind. Someone had given Violet the dog less than a month before, and she'd developed a fierce attachment to it, carrying the dog around in a big straw tote. Liza disliked Baby, and twice when Violet left the dog behind, Liza put her in the coat closet so she wouldn't have to listen to her bark. She'd gotten the idea from Foley, who disliked the dog even more than she did.</p> <p> Liza knocked on the door frame, a sound barely audible above the dog's <i>yap-yap-yap</i>. Violet called out, "Come on in. I'm in the bedroom!"</p> <p> Liza opened the screen door, pushed the dog aside with her foot, and walked through the living room to the bedroom Violet and Foley shared. Liza knew for a fact that Foley often ended up sleeping on the couch, especially when he'd been drinking, which he did almost every day, and even more especially after he'd busted Violet in the chops and she'd stopped speaking to him for two days or however long it was. Foley hated it when she gave him the silent treatment, but by then he'd be sorry he'd slugged her and he wouldn't have the nerve to protest. He told anyone who would listen that she brought it on herself. Anything bad that happened to Foley was someone else's fault.</p> <p> Baby pattered into the bedroom behind her, a fluff ball of nervous energy with a party favor of a tail. She was too small to jump up onto the bed, so Liza scooped her up and put her there. Violet's tow-headed daughter, Daisy, was lying on the bed reading the Little Lulu comic Liza had given her the last time she sat, which was the night before last. Daisy was like a cat-always in the room with you but busy pretending to be doing something else. Liza took a seat on the only chair in the room. Earlier in the day when she'd stopped by, there had been two brown paper bags sitting on the chair. Violet said it was stuff going to the Goodwill, but Liza recognized a couple of Violet's favorite things and thought it was odd that she'd give away her best clothes. Now the brown bags were gone and Liza knew better than to mention them. Violet didn't like questions. What she wanted you to know, she'd tell you outright, and the rest was none of your business. </p><p> "Isn't she adorable?" Violet said. She was talking about the dog, not her seven-year-old child.</p> <p> Liza didn't comment. She was wondering how long it would take to suffocate the Pomeranian while Violet was out. Violet was sitting on the bench at her makeup table, wearing the bright blue kimono with the dragon across the back. As Liza watched, Violet loosened the tie and shrugged the wrap aside so she could examine a bruise the size of Foley's fist that sat above one breast. Liza could see three versions of the bruise reflected in the trifold mirror that rested on the vanity. Violet was small and her back was perfect, her spine straight, her skin flawless. Her buttocks were dimpled and ever so slightly splayed where they pressed down against the seat.</p> <p> Violet wasn't at all self-conscious about Liza seeing her undressed. Often when Liza came to sit, Violet would emerge from the bathroom naked, having dropped the towel so she could dab behind her knees with the violet cologne she used. Liza would try to keep her gaze averted while Violet strolled around the bedroom, pausing to light an Old Gold that she'd leave on the lip of the ashtray. Liza's gaze was irresistibly drawn to the sight of Violet's body. No matter where Violet went, eyes were drawn to her. Her waist was small and her breasts were plump, drooping slightly like sacks filled nearly to capacity with sand. Liza's boobs were barely sufficient for her AA brassiere, though Ty would close his eyes and start breathing hard every time he felt her up. After they kissed for a while, even if she resisted, he'd find a way to unbutton her shirt, nudging aside her bra strap so he could cup a budding breast in his palm. Then he'd grab Liza's hand and press it between his legs, making a sound somewhere between a whimper and a moan.</p> <p> In her church youth group, the pastor's wife often lectured the girls about heavy petting, which was not recommended, as it was the quickest road to sexual intercourse and other forms of loose behavior. Oh, well. Liza's best friend, Kathy, was currently taken up with the Moral Rearmament Movement, which preached Absolute Honesty, Absolute Purity, Absolute Unselfishness, and Absolute Love. The last was the one that appealed to Liza. She and Ty had started dating in April, though their contact was limited. He couldn't let his aunt hear about it because of things that happened at his last school. She'd never been kissed before, had never done any of the things Ty introduced her to in their times together. Of course, she'd drawn the line at going all the way, but she couldn't see the harm in Ty fooling with her boobs if it made him feel good. This was exactly Violet's point of view. When Liza finally confessed what was going on, Violet said, "Oh please, Sweetie, what's it to you? Let him have his fun. He's a good-looking boy, and if you don't give in to him some other girl will."</p> <p> Violet's hair was dyed an astonishing shade of red, more orange than red and not even intended to look real. Her eyes were a clear green, and the lipstick she wore was a pinky rose shade. Violet's lips formed two wide bands across her mouth, as flat as the selvage on a remnant of silk. Her pale skin had an undertone of gold, like fine paper in a book printed long ago. Liza's complexion was freckled, and she tended to break out at "that time of the month." While Violet's hair was as silky as an ad for Breck shampoo, Liza's ends were crinkled and split from a miscalculation with the Toni Home Permanent Kathy'd given her the week before. Kathy had read the directions wrong and fried Liza's hair to a fare-thee-well. The strands still smelled like spoiled eggs from the lotions she'd applied.</p> <p> Violet liked going out, and Liza babysat Daisy three and four times a week. Foley was gone most nights, drinking beer at the Blue Moon, which was the only bar in town. He worked construction, and at the end of the day, he needed to "wet his whistle" was how he put it. He said he wasn't about to stay home babysitting Daisy, and Violet certainly had no intention of sitting around the house with her while Foley was out having fun. During the school year, Liza ended up doing her homework at the Sullivans' after Daisy was in bed. Sometimes Ty came to visit, or Kathy might spend the evening so the two could read movie magazines. <i>True Confession</i> magazine was preferable, but Kathy was worried about impure thoughts.</p> <p> Violet smiled at Liza, their eyes connecting in the mirror until Liza looked away. (Violet preferred to smile with her lips closed because one of her front teeth was chipped where Foley'd knocked her sideways into a door.) Violet liked her. Liza knew this and it made her feel warm. Being favored by Violet was enough to make Liza trot around behind her like a stray pup.</p> <p> Breast inspection complete, Violet shrugged herself back into the kimono and tied it at the waist. She took a deep drag of her cigarette, then rested it in the ashtray so she could finish putting on her face. "How's that boyfriend of yours?"</p> <p> "Fine."</p> <p> "You be careful. You know he's not supposed to date."</p> <p> "I know. He told me and that is so unfair."</p> <p> "Unfair or not, his aunt would have a fit if she knew he was going steady, especially with someone like you."</p> <p> "Gee, thanks. What'd I do to her?"</p> <p> "She thinks you're a bad influence because your mother's divorced."</p> <p> "She <i>told</i> you that?"</p> <p> "More or less," Violet said. "I ran into her at the market and she tried to pump me for information. Someone saw you with Ty and ran blabbing straight to her. Don't ask who tattled because she was very tight-lipped. I told her she was nuts. I was polite about it, but I made sure she got the point. In the first place, I said your mother wouldn't let you date at your age. You're barely fourteen...how ridiculous, I said. And in the second place, you couldn't be seeing Ty because you spent all your spare time with me. She seemed satisfied with that, though I'm sure she doesn't like me any better than she likes you. Guess we're not good enough for her or her precious nephew. She got all pruney around the mouth and went on to say that at his last school, some girl got herself in trouble, if you get my drift."</p> <p> "I know. He told me he felt sorry for her."</p> <p> "So he did her the big favor of screwing her. Wasn't she the lucky one?"</p> <p> "Well, it's over now anyway."</p> <p> "I'll say. Take it from me, you can't trust a guy who's hellbent on getting in your pants."</p> <p> "Even if he loves you?"</p> <p> "Especially if he loves you, and worse if you love him."</p> <p> Violet picked up a wand of mascara and began to sweep her lashes, leaning into the mirror so she could see what she was doing. "I've got Cokes for you in the fridge and a carton of vanilla ice cream if you and Daisy want some."</p> <p> "Thanks."</p> <p> She recapped the wand and used a hand to fan her face, drying the dramatic fringe of black goo. She opened her jewelry box and selected six bracelets, thin silver circles that she slipped over her right hand one by one. She shook her wrist so they jingled together like tiny bells. On her left wrist she fastened her watch with its narrow black-cord band. Barefoot, she got up and crossed to the closet.</p> <p> There was very little evidence of Foley in the room. He kept his clothes jammed in a pressed-board armoire shoved in one corner of Daisy's room, and as Violet was fond of saying, "If he knows what's good for him, he better not complain." Liza watched while she hung the kimono on a hook on the inside of the closet door. She was wearing sheer white nylon underpants but hadn't bothered with a bra. She slipped her feet into a pair of sandals and leaned down to fix the straps, her breasts bobbling as she did. Then she pulled on a lavender-and-white polka-dot sundress that zipped up the back. Liza had to help her with that. The dress fit snugly, and if Violet was aware that her nipples showed as flat as coins she made no remark. Liza was self-conscious about her figure, which had begun developing when she was twelve. She wore loose cotton blouses-usually Ship'n Shore-mindful that her bra and slip straps sometimes showed through the fabric. She found this embarrassing around the boys at school. Ty was seventeen and, having transferred from another school, didn't act stupid the way the others did, with their mouth farts and rude gestures, fists pumping at the front of their pants.</p> <p> Liza said, "What time are the fireworks?"</p> <p> Violet reapplied her lipstick and then rubbed her lips together to even out the color. She recapped the tube. Whenever it gets dark. I'm guessing nine," she said. She leaned forward, blotted her lipstick with a tissue, and then used an index finger to clean a line of color from her teeth.</p> <p> "Are you and Foley coming home right afterward?"</p> <p> "Nah, we'll probably stop by the Moon."</p> <p> Liza wasn't sure why she'd bothered to ask. It was always like that. They'd get home at 2:00 A.M. Liza, dazed and groggy, would collect her four dollars and then walk home through the dark.</p> <p> Violet took the bulk of her hair, twisted it, and held it high on her head, showing the effect. "What do you think? Up or down? It's still hotter than blue blazes."</p> <p> "Down's better."</p> <p> Violet smiled. "Vanity over comfort. Glad I taught you something." She dropped her hair, shaking it out so the weight of it went swinging across her back.</p> <p> That was the sequence Liza remembered-beginning, middle, and end. It was like a short loop of film that ran over and over. Daisy reading her comic book, Violet naked, and then being zipped into the polka-dot sundress. Violet lifting her bright red hair and then shaking it out. The thought of Ty Eddings was wedged in there somewhere because of what happened later. The only other brief moment that stayed with her was a time jump of maybe twenty minutes. Liza was in the cramped, not-quite-clean bathroom with its moldy-smelling towels. Daisy, her fine blond hair caught up in a barrette, was taking her bath. She was sitting in a cloud of bubbles, scooping them up and draping them across her shoulders like a fine fur coat. Once Liza had Daisy bathed and in her baby doll pajamas, she'd give her the pill Violet left for her whenever she went out.</p> <p> The air in the bathroom was damp and warm, and smelled like the pine-scented bubble bath Liza had squirted into the rush of running water. Liza was sitting on the toilet with the lid down, watching to make sure Daisy didn't do something dumb, like drown or get soap in her eyes. Liza was already bored because babysitting was tedious once Violet left the house. She did it only because Violet asked, and who could turn her down? The Sullivans didn't have a television set. The Cramers were the only family in town who owned one. Liza and Kathy watched TV almost every afternoon, though lately Kathy had been sulky, in part because of Ty and in part because of Violet. If Kathy had her way, she and Liza would spend every waking minute together. Kathy had been fun at first, but now Liza felt like she was suffocating.</p> <p> As Liza leaned over and swished a hand in the bathwater, Violet opened the door and stuck her head in, holding Baby in her arms. The dog yapped at them, bright-eyed and happy in a braggy sort of way. Violet said, "Hey, Lies, I'm off. See you kids later."</p> <p> Violet liked to call her "Lies," a shortened form of "Liza" but spelled differently, or at least as Liza pictured it.</p> <p> Daisy tilted her face up, puckering her lips. "Kiss!"</p> <p> Violet said, "Kiss, kiss from here, Honeybunch. This lipstick's fresh and Mama doesn't want it messed up. You be good now and do everything Liza says."</p> <p> Violet blew Daisy a kiss. She pretended to catch it and then blew it back, her eyes shining at the sight of her mother, who was looking radiant. Liza waved, and as the door closed, a waft of violet cologne entered the room on a wisp of chill air.</p> <p> --from <i>S Is For Silence</i> by Sue Grafton, Copyright � 2005 Sue Grafton, published by G.

After Oliver Twist asks nasty Mr Bumble for more food, he has to flee the workhouse for the streets of London. Here he meets the Artful Dodger, who leads him to Fagin and his gang of pickpockets. When a thieving mission goes wrong, Oliver narrowly avoids prison and finds himself in the care of kind Mr Brownlow. But Fagin and the brutal Bill Sikes go in search of the young orphan, determined to drag him back . . .

It was exactly the right size, as if it were made for him all along.<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; the former king shouted from the ground. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do this to me. This is all I had!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not true,&#x201d; Owen said, turning to his former archenemy. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t you, Your Majesty. You&#x2019;re not meant to be evil. Someone&#x2019;s rewritten your story, just as you tried to do for Bethany.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not?&#x201d; the former king said. &#x201c;Then what was I meant to be?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A father,&#x201d; Owen said quietly, then wrote something on his paper.<br> <br>The former King of All Stories turns back into his real self.<br> <br>Instantly a bright light filled the room, then spread out over the entire Kingdom of Stories, blinding anyone who happened to be looking at the castle at that moment. The light enveloped the former king, raising him into the air in a completely awesome way.<br> <br>The light became too bright to look at, and they all covered their eyes except Owen, who wrote himself sunglasses that made him look even cooler. Then abruptly, the light disappeared and everything went dark.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like this story,&#x201d; Owen said, pulling off his sunglasses, &#x201c;just started a new chapter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany slowly stepped past Owen, her eyes on the figure on the ground.

It&#x2019;d been done a thousand times.<br> <br>He began to idly tap the keys without pressing them while he stared off into space. When he glanced back at the computer, though, there were new words. Apparently he&#x2019;d been typing without realizing it?<br> <br>&#x201c;Owen,&#x201d; said a man who appeared out of nowhere, with no features or details anywhere on his body. The mannequin-looking man had his back to the Owen in the story as he spoke to the real Owen. &#x201c;Stop this at once. You&#x2019;re manipulating fictional characters&#x2019; lives. Do you have any idea what you&#x2019;re doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen&#x2019;s eyes widened as he read the lines, while at his side, Spike began to growl, low and menacing. Owen hadn&#x2019;t just written those words . . . had he?<br> <br>And then more text appeared on the screen, without Owen even moving his hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do not write again,&#x201d; Nobody said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to have to tell you this twice.&#x201d; And with that, he disappeared.<br> <br>A chill went through Owen, and he quickly reread the last few lines. What had just happened? Was that really Nobody? And if so, was Owen actually messing with real fictional people&#x2019;s lives? Had he just created another fictional Owen?<br> <br>He quickly highlighted the entire story, ready to hit the delete button, then froze. What if he had created new people, and was now going to delete them? Would that take them out of existence somehow? His finger hovered over the button as he looked to Spike for an answer. But now that Nobody was gone, the cat seemed to have returned to his nap, not paying any attention.<br> <br>Should he delete the story, or was that worse? If only there was someone he could ask&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;OWEN!&#x201d; shouted someone from mere inches away.<br> <br>Owen screamed and tumbled out of his chair, while Spike tore away across the room, hiding under the bed. His heart racing, Owen turned to find Bethany&#x2019;s head sticking out of a piece of paper on his desk, and he gave her the dirtiest look he could.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that! You scared me half to death!&#x201d; She&#x2019;d given him a page from a book she kept hidden under her bed. In case of emergencies (fictional characters escaping their books, libraries burning down, that kind of thing) she could jump in one page, move to the next part of the story, then pop out of his. But it was not meant for terrifying him!<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, you should be scared!&#x201d; she said, breathing heavily. &#x201c;Because that guy is back on the street again, the one who keeps watching my house!&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen groaned loudly. &#x201c;Seriously? This again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, is my being stalked by a crazy person boring to you?&#x201d; Bethany asked, giving him a sarcastic look. &#x201c;Get over here and help me spy on him!&#x201d; She moved her head to the side, and one hand popped out of the page.<br> <br>Owen shook his head. &#x201c;No way. Remember what happened last time I came over to check on this guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany rolled her eyes. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t there, but only because he must have seen us coming!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the time before that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That one, I got the car wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And we terrified that poor old lady!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then she shouldn&#x2019;t be acting so suspiciously!&#x201d; Bethany yelled, her hand flying around wildly. &#x201c;Who sits in their car for ten minutes at eleven at night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She couldn&#x2019;t get it started!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she wanted us to think,&#x201d; Bethany said, glancing around suspiciously. &#x201c;Hurry up, or he might leave again!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which would mean he&#x2019;s not actually spying on you,&#x201d; Owen said, sighing. &#x201c;Bethany, it&#x2019;s been a while since we jumped into a book&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two months, three weeks, and four days, actually. Now come on&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I know it&#x2019;s been hard on you. But you&#x2019;re kind of acting . . . different now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany&#x2019;s face froze, and she pulled her hand back into the page. &#x201c;What? What are you talking about? Don&#x2019;t you get it? This could be Doyle, or Fowen again. Maybe Fowen got out of the book where I left him and is back for revenge. Or maybe Doyle remembered everything that happened and wants to figure out how I jump into books. If Kiel were here instead of running off to find out who he is without magic, he could just cast a spell or something to find out who this guy is. But without him, we&#x2019;re going to need a good plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen groaned again. &#x201c;No more mysteries. Please? Fowen and Doyle are both still in the fictional world where we left them. And whoever&#x2019;s parked outside your house is probably one of your neighbors, which would explain why he&#x2019;s on your street.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m making this up, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Bethany said, looking suspicious.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not . . . entirely. I just think you used to jump into books every night, and now, well, your imagination doesn&#x2019;t have as much to play with, so it&#x2019;s messing with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave him an evil look and started to say something, then stopped, shaking her head. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re right. I might have a little bit of cabin fever or something. I&#x2019;ll just go to bed and forget all this. See you tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, of course,&#x201d; Owen said, breathing a sigh of relief. He&#x2019;d been worried about saying something for weeks now, but she&#x2019;d been getting more and more frantic to find something exciting in their fairly boring lives, and it was out of control. &#x201c;And Bethany? Only use that page for emergencies. I might not have clothes on or something!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany rolled her eyes, then waved good-bye and disappeared.<br> <br>Owen slowly got back into his chair, and Spike came trotting out from under the bed, then jumped into his lap. He petted his cat for a moment, then sighed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bethany&#x2019;s going after the guy in the car, isn&#x2019;t she.&#x201d;<br> <br>Spike just purred in response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Owen said, and set Spike on his bed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go, but this guy better be a murderer or something, or I&#x2019;m going to be really annoyed!&#x201d;</p><h2>Paper Pups</h2><p><p>Punch out, Fold up and...Voila!

(The New York Times)</p><p> Like towering divas, skyscrapers command the urban stage. They hold us enthralled, leaving us anticipating and half-fearing their next majestic manifestation. The roles played by the skyscraper and many: they are icons of cities, stars of movies, symbols of corporate power, and the place where many of us report to work every morning. Deemed both avatars and annihilators of civilized life, they have been praised as efficient space-savers and denounced as rapacious consumers of light and air. In short, the skyscraper's bold visual gestalt, one layered with multiple meanings, has become a complex metaphor for all that is good and bad about the twentieth century. (Judith Dupre, from the Foreword)</p><p> I think the interesting question is why does man want to build to the sky? What is there about the desire for domination, or to reach God, or for private pride - the Pyramids are an example of that, but the tall building is certainly another. Every civilization is touched by that desire... They all reached for a dominant height. The impulse may have been different, but that's a common feeling of must culture.

They were preparing to compete in a poker tournament with million-dollar stakes, but those numbers meant nothing to them. They were accustomed to risking <i>billions.</i> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On that night, these four men and their cohorts were the new kings of Wall Street. &nbsp;Muller, Griffin, Asness, and Weinstein were among the best and brightest of a new breed, the <i>quants</i>. Over the prior twenty years, this species of math whiz--technocrats who make billions not with gut calls or fundamental analysis but with formulas and high-speed computers--had usurped the testosterone-fueled, kill-or-be-killed risk-takers who&#x2019;d long been the alpha males the world&#x2019;s largest casino. The quants helped create a digitized money-trading machine that could shift billions around the globe with the click of a mouse. Few realized, though, that in creating this unprecedented machine, men like Muller, Griffin, Asness and Weinstein had sowed the seeds for history&#x2019;s greatest financial disaster. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on unprecedented access to these four number-crunching titans, <i>The Quants </i>tells the inside story of what they thought and felt in the days and weeks when they helplessly watched much of their net worth vaporize--and wondered just how their mind-bending formulas and genius-level IQ&#x2019;s had led them so wrong, so fast.&nbsp;</p><p><b>SCOTT PATTERSON</b>&nbsp;is author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling book <i>The Quants </i>and<i> Dark Pools</i> and a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal.

He lives in Alexandria, Virginia.1: All in One<br><br>Peter Muller stepped into the posh Versailles Room of the century old&nbsp;St. Regis Hotel in midtown Manhattan and took in the glittering scene in a glance.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the trio of cut-glass chandeliers hung from a gilt-laden ceiling that caught his attention, nor the pair of antique floor-to-ceiling mirrors to his left, nor the guests&#x2019; svelte Armani suits and gemstudded dresses. Something else in the air made him smile: the smell of money. And the sweet perfume of something he loved even more: pure, unbridled testosterone-fueled competition. It was intoxicating, and it was all around him, from the rich fizz of a fresh bottle of champagne popping open to the knowing nods and winks of his friends as he moved into a room that was a virtual murderer&#x2019;s row of topflight bankers and hedge fund managers, the richest in the world. His people.<br><br>It was March 8, 2006, and the Wall Street Poker Night Tournament was about to begin. More than a hundred well- heeled players milled about the room, elite traders and buttoned-down dealmakers by day, gambling enthusiasts by night. The small, private affair was a gathering of a select group of wealthy and brilliant individuals who had, through<br>sheer brainpower and a healthy dose of daring, become the new tycoons of Wall Street. This high-finance haut monde&#x2014;perhaps Muller most of all&#x2014;was so secretive that few people outside the room had ever heard their names. And yet, behind the scenes, their decisions controlled the ebb and flow of billions of dollars coursing through the<br>global financial system every day.<br><br>Mixed in with the crowd were professional poker players such as T. J. Cloutier, winner of sixty major tournaments, and Clonie Gowen, a blond Texan bombshell with the face of a fashion model and the body of a <i>Playboy</i> pinup. More important to the gathering crowd, Gowen was one of the most successful female poker players in the country.<br><br>Muller, tan, fit, and at forty-two looking a decade younger than his age, a wiry Pat Boone in his prime, radiated the relaxed cool of a man accustomed to victory. He waved across the room to Jim Simons, billionaire math genius and founder of the most successful hedge fund on the planet, Renaissance Technologies. Simons, a balding, whitebearded<br>wizard of quantitative investing, winked back as he continued chatting with the circle of admirers hovering around him.<br><br>The previous year, Simons had pocketed $1.5 billion in hedge fund fees, at the time the biggest one-year paycheck ever earned by a hedge fund manager. His elite team of traders, hidden away in a small enclave on Long Island, marshaled the most mind-bending advances in science and mathematics, from quantum physics to artificial intelligence to voice recognition technology, to wring billions in profits from the market. Simons was the rare investor who could make Muller feel jaw-clenchingly jealous. <br><br>The two had known each other since the early 1990s, when Muller briefly considered joining Renaissance before starting his own quantitative hedge fund inside Morgan Stanley, the giant New York investment bank. Muller&#x2019;s elite trading group, which he called Process Driven Trading, was so secretive that even most employees at Morgan weren&#x2019;t aware of its existence. Yet over the previous decade the group, composed of only about fifty people, had racked up a track record that could go toe-to-toe with the best investment outfits on Wall Street, cranking out $6 billion in gains for Morgan.<br><br>Muller and Simons were giants among an unusual breed of investors known as &#x201c;quants.&#x201d; They used brain-twisting math and superpowered computers to pluck billions in fleeting dollars out of the market. By the early 2000s, such tech-savvy investors had come to dominate Wall Street, helped by theoretical breakthroughs in the application<br>of mathematics to financial markets, advances that had earned their discoverers several shelves of Nobel Prizes. The quants applied those same breakthroughs to the highly practical, massively profitable practice of calculating predictable patterns in how the market moved and worked.<br><br>These computer-driven investors couldn&#x2019;t care less about a company&#x2019;s &#x201c;fundamentals,&#x201d; amorphous qualities such as the morale of its employees or the cut of its chief executive&#x2019;s jib. That was for the dinosaurs of Wall Street, the Warren Buffetts and Peter Lynches of the world, investors who focused on factors such as what a company actually<br>made and whether it made it well. Quants were agnostic on such matters, devoting themselves instead to predicting whether a company&#x2019;s stock would move up or down based on a dizzying array of numerical variables such as how cheap it was relative to the rest of the market, how quickly the stock had risen or declined, or a combination<br>of the two&#x2014;and much more.<br><br>That night at the St. Regis was a golden hour for the quants, a predators&#x2019; ball for the pocket-protector set. They were celebrating their dominance of Wall Street, just as junk bond kings such as Michael Milken had ruled the financial world in the 1980s or swashbuckling, trade-from-the-hip hedge fund managers such as George Soros had conquered the Street in the 1990s.<br><br>Muller flicked a lock of sandy brown hair from his eyes and snatched a glass of wine from a passing tray, looking for his friends. A few nonquants, fundamental investors of the old guard, rubbed elbows with the quant crowd that night. David Einhorn, the boy-faced manager of Greenlight Capital (so named when his wife gave him the green light to launch a fund in the 1990s), could be seen chatting on a cell phone by a tall, narrow window overlooking the corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue. Just thirty-seven years old, Einhorn was quickly gaining a reputation as one of the sharpest fundamental investors in the business, putting up returns of 20 percent or more year after year. Einhorn was also an ace poker player who would place eighteenth in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas the following year, winning $659,730.<br><br>The next billionaire Muller spotted was Ken Griffin, the blueeyed, notoriously ruthless manager of Chicago&#x2019;s Citadel Investment Group, one of the largest and most successful hedge funds in the business. Grave dancer of the hedge funds, Citadel was known for sweeping in on distressed companies and gobbling up the remains of the bloodied carcasses. But the core engines of his fund were computer driven mathematical models that guided its every move. Griffin, who sported a no-nonsense buzz cut of jet-black hair, was the sort of man who triggered a dark sense of foreboding even in close associates: <i>Wouldn&#x2019;t want to mess with Ken in a dark alley. Does he ever smile? The guy wants to be king of everything he touches.<br></i><br>&#x201c;Petey boy.&#x201d;<br><br>Muller felt a jolt in his back. It was his old friend and poker pal Cliff Asness, manager of AQR Capital Management, among the first pure quant hedge funds. Asness, like Muller, Griffin, and Simons, was a pioneer among the quants, having started out at Goldman Sachs in the early 1990s.<br><br>&#x201c;Decided to grace us tonight?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Asness knew Muller wouldn&#x2019;t miss this quant poker coronation for the world. Muller was obsessed with poker, had been for years. He&#x2019;d recently roped Asness into a private high-stakes poker game played with several other traders and hedge fund hotshots in ritzy Manhattan hotel rooms. The game had a $10,000 buy-in, couch cushion change to topflight traders such as Asness and Muller.<br><br>The quants ran the private poker game, but more traditional investment titans joined in. Carl Icahn, the billionaire financier who&#x2019;d gotten his start on Wall Street with $4,ooo in poker winnings, was a regular. So was Marc Lasry, manager of Avenue Capital Group, the $12 billion hedge fund that would hire former first daughter Chelsea Clinton<br>later that year. Lasry was known for being a cool investor whose icy demeanor belied his let-it-roll mentality. He was said to have once wagered $100,000 on a hand without even looking at his cards. And won.<br><br>The real point of Asness&#x2019;s needle was that he never knew when the globetrotting Muller would be in town. One week he&#x2019;d be trekking in Bhutan or white-water rafting in Bolivia, the next heli-skiing in the Grand Tetons or singing folk songs in a funky cabaret in Greenwich Village. Muller had even been spotted belting out Bob Dylan tunes in<br>New York&#x2019;s subway system, his keyboard case sprinkled with coins from charitable commuters with no idea the seemingly down-on-his luck songster was worth hundreds of millions and flew around in a private jet.<br><br>Asness, a stocky, balding man with a meaty face and impish blue eyes, wore khaki pants and a white tee peeking out from his open collar. He winked, stroking the orange-gray stubble of his trimmed beard. Though he lacked Muller&#x2019;s savoir faire, Asness was far wealthier, manager of his own hedge fund, and a rising power in the investment world. His firm, AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, was managing $25 billion and growing fast.<br><br>The year before, Asness had been the subject of a lengthy and glowing profile in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. He was a scourge of bad practices in the money management industry, such as ridiculously high fees at mutual funds. And he had the intellectual chops to back up his attacks. Known as one of the smartest investors in the world, Asness had worked hard for his success. He&#x2019;d been a standout student at the University of Chicago&#x2019;s prestigious economics department in the early 1990s, then a star at Goldman Sachs in the mid-1990s before branching out on his own in 1998 to launch AQR with $1 billion and change, a near record at the time. His ego had grown along with his wallet, and so, too, had his temper. While outsiders knew Asness for his razor-sharp mind tempered by a wry, self-effacing sense of humor, inside AQR he was known for flying into computer-smashing rampages and shooting off ego-crushing emails to his cowed employees at all hours of the day or night. His poker buddies loved Asness&#x2019;s cutting wit and encyclopedic memory, but they&#x2019;d also seen his darker side, his volatile temper and sudden rages at a losing hand.</p><h2>Sabriel (Old Kingdom, 1)</h2><p><p><em>Game of Thrones</em> fans will love the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Abhorsen series. <em>Sabriel</em>, the first installment in the trilogy, launched critically acclaimed author Garth Nix onto the fantasy scene as a rising star.</p><p>Since childhood, Sabriel has lived outside the walls of the Old Kingdom, away from the power of Free Magic, and away from the Dead who refuse to stay dead. But now her father, the Abhorson, is missing, and Sabriel must cross into that world to find him. With Mogget, whose feline form hides a powerful, perhaps malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage, Sabriel travels deep into the Old Kingdom. There she confronts an evil that threatens much more than her life and comes face-to-face with her own hidden destiny. . . .</p></p><p>After receiving a cryptic message from her father, Abhorsen, a necromancer trapped in Death, 18-year-old Sabriel sets off into the Old Kingdom. Fraught with peril and deadly trickery, her journey takes her to a world filled with parasitical spirits, Mordicants, and Shadow Hands. Unlike other necromancers, who raise the dead, Abhorsen lays the disturbed dead back to rest. This obliges him--and now Sabriel, who has taken on her father's title and duties--to slip over the border into the icy river of Death, sometimes battling the evil forces that lurk there, waiting for an opportunity to escape into the realm of the living. Desperate to find her father, and grimly determined to help save the Old Kingdom from destruction by the horrible forces of the evil undead, Sabriel endures almost impossible exhaustion, violent confrontations, and terrifying challenges to her supernatural abilities--and her destiny. <p> Garth Nix delves deep into the mystical underworld of necromancy, magic, and the monstrous undead. This tale is not for the faint of heart; imbedded in the classic good-versus-evil story line are subplots of grisly ghouls hungry for human life to perpetuate their stay in the world of the living, and dark, devastating secrets of betrayal and loss. Just <i>try</i> to put this book down. For more along this line, try Nix's later novel: <i>Shade's Children</i>. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Dark Secrets, Deep Love, and Dangerous Magic</p><p>Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child, Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom. But during her final semester, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing, and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him. She soon finds companions in Mogget, a cat whose aloof manner barely conceals its malevolent spirit, and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage long imprisoned by magic, now free in body but still trapped by painful memories. As the three travel deep into the Old Kingdom, threats mount on all sides. And every step brings them closer to a battle that will pit them against the true forces of life and death&#x2014;and bring Sabriel face-to-face with her own destiny.</p><p>With <em>Sabriel</em>, the first installment in the Abhorsen trilogy, Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star, in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isn't always clear&#x2014;and sometimes disappears altogether.</p></p><h2>Prevent-Teach-Reinforce for Young Children: The Early Childhood Model of Individualized Positive Behavior Support</h2><p><p>Now early childhood professionals have their own guide to the popular Prevent-Teach-Reinforce (PTR) model&#x2014;the research-proven, family-centered approach used in schools nationwide to resolve challenging behaviors.

They send for their brother and are surprised to see him leading a band of soldiers into the town. After he left home near the end of The Good Earth, he joined the army of a warlord and quickly rose in the ranks. Once Wang Lung is dead and buried and his land divided among the sons, they find themselves drawn together in unusual ways even as they drift apart.Wang the Third (&#x201c;The Tiger&#x201d;) demands that his brothers (Eldest, &#x201c;The Landlord,&#x201d; and Second, &#x201c;The Merchant&#x201d;) sell his share and give him his inheritance in silver, and also asks to borrow as much money as they can lend him. He needs the funds in order to break away from the warlord and set himself up with an army of his own. Since he has no sons, he asks his brothers to send him some of theirs, receiving one from each of them. The Merchant's smallpox-scarred oldest son quickly proves himself a useful aide, but the Landlord's dainty second son hates life as a soldier and hangs himself during a visit to the family home. As time passes, the Landlord is forced to sell much of his share of the land in order to support his family's lavish lifestyle, with the Merchant buying the best tracts for himself.</p><p></p><h2>Sandy Koufax: A Lefty&#39;s Legacy</h2><p><p>No immortal in the history of baseball retired so young, so well, or so completely as Sandy Koufax. After compiling a remarkable record from 1962 to 1966 that saw him lead the National League in ERA all five years, win three Cy Young awards, and pitch four no-hitters including a perfect game, Koufax essentially disappeared. Save for his induction into the Hall of Fame and occasional appearances at the Dodgers training camp, Koufax has remained unavailable, unassailable, and unsullied, in the process becoming much more than just the best pitcher of his generation. He is the Jewish boy from Brooklyn, who refused to pitch the opening game of the 1965 World Series on Yom Kippur, defining himself as a man who placed faith over fame. This act made him the standard to which Jewish parents still hold their children. Except for his autobiography (published in 1966), Koufax has resolutely avoided talking about himself. But through sheer doggedness that even Koufax came to marvel at, Jane Leavy was able to gain his trust to the point where they talked regularly over the three years Leavy reported her book. With Koufax&#x2032;s blessing, Leavy interviewed nearly every one of his former teammates, opponents, and friends, and emerged with a portrait of the artist that is as thorough and stylish as was his command on the pitching mound.</p></p><p><p>Jane Leavy, award-winning former sportswriter and feature writer for the <em>Washington Post</em>, is author of the <em>New York Times </em>bestsellers <em>Sandy Koufax: A Lefty&#x2019;s Legacy</em>, <em>The Last Boy: Mickey Mantle and the</em> <em>End of America&#x2019;s Childhood</em>, and the comic novel <em>Squeeze Play</em>. She lives in Washington, D.C. and Truro, Massachusetts.</p>A LEFTY'S LEGACY is an amazing biography of an incomparable pitcher, a story that exemplifies courage, tenacity, and modesty. Former Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, who immortalized Koufax in his poem "Night Game," reads most of the book, with alternating chapters read by the author. The story is a fascinating one, and Leavy reminds us that Koufax on the mound was poetry in motion. Pinsky is a moving reader, whether performing his own poems or classic haiku. But his New Jersey baritone is more a reflection of bookishness than the Brooklyn barrio, making him an unusual choice to read a book about professional baseball. Parents and teachers should take note that the book is peppered with locker-room language inappropriate for younger listeners.

While Quantum Mechanics, relativity, non-Euclidean geometries, non-Aristotelian logic and General Semantics have revolutionized our view of the world, the habits of daily human thought still sit deeply rooted in the thought patterns and linguistic conventions of the middle ages.

He represented the grooming industry on the New York City Board of Education Animal Advisory Commission. </p><p> In 2011, Mr. Kohl was the first recipient of Barkleigh's Sally Liddick Lifetime Achievement Award for his many years of contribution to the grooming industry. </p><p> Working with the students and the grooming equipment available at that time made him acutely aware of the lack of tools that would facilitate peak performance. When he was unable to convince existing grooming tool manufacturers of the need for improvement, he turned to designing himself. He established the Aaronco Pet Products company in 1987, designing and manufacturing innovative tools to improve the labor-intensive grooming process.</p>As a groomer I am always learning, improving and trying new techniques, new breeds start stepping up to my table making my job quite interesting some times. One of the items I always have on hand for such situations is my grooming guide. To be honest I never like Sam Kohl s old book, in my opinion everything looked very old indeed, it was not fun at all to look at it. Well not anymore, Mr. Sam Kohl has been very busy in the past years updating his All Breed Dog Grooming Guide and let me tell you it is fantastic. This is not another book to get and put aside, this is a complete grooming course. The book is composed of two main sections: Section one describes the complete grooming cycle; from start to finish, section two has the complete instructions for grooming each 193 recognized AKC breeds. Section one dedicates time to ear care, eye care, the face, nails, pads, caring for the coat bathing process, finish the dog and more. It goes over common mistakes groomers make that put our health in jeopardy. You will find exercises and warm ups to start the day and there is a lot of emphasis on safety. Chapter two is dedicated to handling and control, in my opinion, one of the most important steps of the grooming process. I have been in situations with dogs that other salons hate and banned and because of my handling process, they are angels in my table. Do you know how to choose your table, equipment and tools available these days? I can go over every chapter in this book and how these pages are full of fantastic advice for new or seasoned groomers. One of my favorites parts on the book is the amount of photos in it when he is talking about a specific tool or technique there is a photo next to it to help you visualize it. The language is very easy to read and understand and all the instructions are easy to follow. You know how a conditioner freak I am well, they have a chart with the recommended conditioner based on the type of coat, I look at this book every night and every night I find something new or a better way to do it compared of how I am doing it now. When Mrs. Kohl emailed me and let me know she sent me the book, she asked me a question how many new things I learned from the book they did not teach me at school? I lost the count already. No matter what school you went, you would find new or different techniques for basic grooming. The attention to detail on this guide is amazing. I love doing the schnauzer, no matter how many I have done the eyebrows are never the same, I always go back again to even them over and over. On this guide I learn how to use the curve shear and to point it to a specific area of the nose to make them long or short and I only do one cut now, I just love the way my schnauzer brows look all the time now. Do you use one of those magnetic strips to hold your blades? You will find out why you need to stop doing that. Proper body positioning for scissoring or styling, there is a little guide to clip the nail and it tells you when to stop before the quick. I mean the list goes on and on. It is fantastic. Now the second part is the best. First it start with canine anatomy, a seasoned groomer may know all this but some times I was reading instructions for a specific groom and they where mentioning the stifle, the tuck-up, point of rump, point of shoulder and I have no idea what they where talking about. There is a complete chart in the book. All the breeds are on alphabetical order by the name. In my old book I had to know the breed group to find them, on this one I just need to know the name. I will tell you all the equipment you will need or is recommended for each breed. Then you will have step-by-step instructions with a small chart with numbers corresponding to the instructions....

He smiled back at her, shaking a lock of blond hair off his forehead.<br><br> "To hell with your diploma, I meant after last night" She grinned at him again, and he rapidly swatted her behind.<br><br> "Smartass.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you feel, Miss McAllister? Can you still walk?" They were hitching their legs over the bicycles now and she looked back at him teasingly in answer.<br><br> "Can you?" And with that, she was off, pulling ahead of him on the pretty little bike he had bought her for her birthday only a few months before.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in love with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had always been in love with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had dreamed of her all his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;And he had known her for two years.<br><br> It had been a lonely time at Harvard before that, and well into his second year of graduate school he was resigned to more of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't want what the others wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't want Radcliffe or Vassar or Wellesley in bed with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had known too many of those girls during his undergraduate days, and for Michael there was always something missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted something more. Texture, substance, soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had solved the problem for himself very nicely the summer before, with an affair with one of his mother's friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that his mother had known.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it had been fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a damned attractive woman in her late thirties, years younger than his mother, of course, and she was an editor at <i>Vogue</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that had been merely sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both of them. Nancy was different.<br><br> He had known from the first moment he had seen her in the Boston gallery that showed her paintings.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a haunting loneliness about her countrysides, a solitary tenderness about her people that filled him with compassion and made him want to reach out to them and to the artist who painted them.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been sitting there that day in a red beret and an old raccoon coat, her delicate skin still glowing from her walk to the Charles Street gallery, her eyes shining, her face alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had never wanted any woman as he wanted her.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had bought two of her paintings, and taken her to dinner at Lockober's.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rest had taken longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy McAllister wasn't quick to give her body or her heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been too lonely for too long to give herself easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;At nineteen she was already wise and well versed in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of being alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of being left.&nbsp;&nbsp;It had plagued her since she had been put in the orphanage as a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;She could no longer remember the day her mother had left her there shortly before she died.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she remembered the chill of the halls.&nbsp;&nbsp;The smells of the strange people.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds in the morning as she lay in her bed fighting back tears.&nbsp;&nbsp;She would remember those things for the rest of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time she had thought nothing could fill the emptiness inside her.&nbsp;&nbsp;But now she had Michael.<br><br> Theirs wasn't always an easy relationship, but it was a strong one, built on love and respect; they had meshed her world and his, and come up with something beautiful and rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Michael was no fool either.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the dangers of falling in love with someone "different," as his mother put it when she got the chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was nothing "different" about Nancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing different was that she was an artist, not just a student.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wasn't still searching, she already was what she wanted to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlike the other women he knew, she wasn't auditioning candidates, she had chosen the man she loved. In two years he had never let her down.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was certain he never would: they knew each other too well.&nbsp;&nbsp;What could there possibly be that she hadn't already learned? She knew it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;The funny stuff, the silly secrets, the childhood dreams, the desperate fears.&nbsp;&nbsp;And through him she had come to respect his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even his mother.<br><br> Michael had been born into a tradition, groomed since childhood to inherit a throne.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't something he took lightly, or even joked about.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it actually frightened him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he live up to the legend? But Nancy knew he would.&nbsp;&nbsp;His grandfather, Richard Cotter, had been an architect, and his father as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Michael's grandfather who had founded an empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was the merging of the Cotter business with the Hillyard fortune, through the marriage of Michael's parents, that had created the Cotter-Hillyard of today. Richard Cotter had known how to make money, but it was the Hillyard money--old money--that had brought with it the rites and traditions of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, at times, a heavy mantle to wear, but not one Michael disliked.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nancy respected it too.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew that one day Michael would be at the helm of Cotter-Hillyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning they had talked about it incessantly, and then again later, when they realized how serious their affair really was.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Michael knew that he had found a woman who could handle it, the family responsibilities as well as the business duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The orphanage had done nothing to prepare Nancy for the role Michael knew she would fill, but the groundwork seemed to be laid in her very soul.<br><br> He watched her now with almost unbearable pride as she sped ahead of him, so sure of herself, so strong, the lithe legs pedaling deftly, her chin tucked over her shoulder now and then to look at him and laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to speed ahead and take her off the bike...there...on the grass...the way they had the night before...the way...He swept the thought from his mind and raced after her.<br><br> "Hey, wait for me, you little twerp!" He was abreast of her in a few moments, and as they rode along, more quietly now, he held out a hand across the narrow gap between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look beautiful today, Nancy." His voice was a caress in the spring air, and around them the world was fresh and green.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how much I love you?"<br><br> "Oh, maybe half as much as I love you, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillyard?"<br><br> "That shows what you know, Miss Nancy Fancypants."&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed, as always, at the nickname.&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael always made her happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;He did wonderful things.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had thought so from the first moment he walked into the gallery and threatened to take off all his clothes if she didn't sell him all her paintings.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I happen to love you at least seven times as much as you love me."<br><br> "Nope."&nbsp;&nbsp;She grinned at him again, put her nose in the air, and sped ahead again.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you more, Michael."<br><br> "How do you know?" He was pressing to catch up.<br><br> "Santa Claus told me." And with that she sped ahead again, and this time he let her move out on the narrow path.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were in a festive mood and he liked watching her.&nbsp;&nbsp;The slim shape of her hips in jeans, the narrow waist, the trim shoulders with the red sweater loosely tied about them, and that wonderful swing of dark hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could watch her for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he was planning to do just that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which reminded him...he had been meaning to talk to her about that all morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;He narrowed the gap between them again, and tapped her gently on the shoulder.<br><br> "Excuse me, Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillyard."&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped a little at the words, and then smiled shyly at him as the sun shone across her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could see tiny freckles there, almost like gold dust left by elves on the creamy surface of her skin. "I said...Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillyard..." He mouthed the words with infinite pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had waited for two years.<br><br> "Aren't you rushing things a little, Michael?"&nbsp;&nbsp;She sounded hesitant, almost afraid.&nbsp;&nbsp;He hadn't spoken to Marion yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what he and Nancy had agreed to between themselves.<br><br> "I don't think I'm rushing anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was thinking about doing it two weeks from now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right after graduation."&nbsp;&nbsp;They had long since agreed on a small intimate wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy had no family, and Michael wanted to share the moment with Nancy, not a cast of thousands or an army of society photographers. "In fact, I was planning to go down to New York to talk to Marion about it tonight."<br><br> "Tonight?" There was an echo of fear in the word, and she let the bicycle come to a slow stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded in answer, and she grew pensive as she looked out at the lush hills around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think she'll say?"&nbsp;&nbsp;She was afraid to look at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid to hear.<br><br> "<i>Yes</i>, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you really worried about it?" But it was a stupid question and they both knew it.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had plenty to worry about.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marion was no flower girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was Michael's mother, and she had all the tenderness of the <i>Titanic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>She was a woman of power, of determination, of concrete and steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had carried on the family business after her father died and again with renewed determination after her husband's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing stopped Marion Hillyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly not a chit of a girl or her only son.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she didn't want them to get married, nothing would make her grant that "yes" Michael pretended to be so sure of.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nancy knew exactly what Marion Hillyard thought of her.<br><br> Marion had never made any secret of her feelings, or at least, not from the moment she decided that Michael's "fling" with "that artist might be for real. She had called Michael down to New York and cooed, soothed, and charmed, after which she had stormed, threatened, and baited.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she had resigned herself or seemed to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael had taken it as an encouraging sign, but Nancy wasn't so sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a feeling that Marion knew what she was doing; for the present she had clearly decided to ignore "the situation."&nbsp;&nbsp;Invitations were not extended, accusations were not made, apologies for things said to Michael in the past were never forthcoming, but no fresh problems had sprung up either. For her, Nancy simply did not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;And oddly, Nancy was always surprised to find just how much that hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no family of her own, she had always had odd dreams about Marion.&nbsp;&nbsp;That they might be friends, that Marion would like her, that she and Marion would go shopping for Michael...that Marion would be...the mother she had never had or known.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Marion was not easily cast in that role.&nbsp;&nbsp;In two years, Nancy had had ample opportunity to understand that. Only Michael obstinately held to the position that his mother would come around, that once she had accepted the inevitable, they would be great friends. But Nancy was never that sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had even forced Michael to discuss the possibility of Marion's never accepting her, never agreeing to the marriage. Then what?..."Then we hop in the car and head for the nearest justice of the peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're both of age now, you know."&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy had smiled at the simplicity of his solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew it would never be as easy as that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what did it matter? After two years together, they felt married anyway."<br><br> They stood in silence for a long moment, looking at the view, and then Michael took Nancy's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you, babe."<br><br> "I love you too."&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at him worriedly and he silenced her eyes with a kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing could still the questions that either of them had.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing except the interview with Marion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy let her bike fall and with a sigh, slipped slowly into Michael's arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish it were easier, Michael."<br><br> "It will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll see.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now come on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we going to ride, or just stand here all day?" He swatted her behind again and she smiled as he picked up her bike for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a moment they were off again, laughing and playing and singing, pretending that Marion didn't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;She always would. Marion was more an institution than a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marion was forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Michael's life anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And now in Nancy's.<br><br> The sun rose higher in the sky as they pedaled through the countryside, alternately riding ahead of each other or side by side, at one moment raucously teasing, at the next growing silent and thoughtful.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was almost noon when they reached Revere Beach and saw the familiar face riding toward them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Ben Avery, with a new girl at his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another leggy blonde.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all looked like homecoming queens, and most of them were.<br><br> "Hi, you two.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the fair?" Ben grinned at them, and then with a vague wave of his hand introduced Jeannette.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all exchanged a round of hellos, and Nancy shielded her eyes to glance ahead at the fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was still several blocks away.<br><br> "Is it worth stopping for?"<br><br> "Hell, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;We won a pink dog-- he pointed at the ugly little creature in Jeannette's basket--"a green turtle, which somehow got lost, and two cans of beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, they have corn on the cob and it's terrific."<br><br> "You just sold me."&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael looked over at Nancy and smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shall we?"<br><br> "Sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;You guys going back already?" But she could see that they were.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben had a recognizable gleam in his eyes, and Jeannette seemed to be in agreement. Nancy smiled to herself as she watched them.<br><br> "Yeah, we've been out since about six this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm beat.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you two doing for dinner tonight, by the way? Want to stop in for a pizza?" Ben's room was only a few doors down from Mike's.<br><br> "What are we doing for dinner, se�or?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy looked at Michael with a broad smile, but he was shaking his head.<br><br> "I have some business to attend to tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe another time."&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a rapid reminder of the meeting with Marion.<br><br> "Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;See ya."&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben and Jeannette waved and were off, as Nancy stared at Michael."<br><br> "You're really going down to see her tonight?"<br><br> "Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And stop worrying about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is going to be just fine.&nbsp;&amp;...</p><h2>Utopia</h2><p>Utopia By Sir Thomas More is a work of political philosophy primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social and political customs.

He was also a councillor to Henry VIII, and Lord High Chancellor of England from October 1529 to 16 May 1532. More opposed the Protestant Reformation, in particular the theology of Martin Luther and William Tyndale. He also wrote Utopia, published in 1516, about the political system of an imaginary ideal island nation. More opposed the King's separation from the Catholic Church, refusing to acknowledge Henry as Supreme Head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.

(CHAPTER 1)<p>My mamm once told me that some places are too beautiful for anything bad to happen. When I was a kid, I believed those words with all of my young heart. I lived my life in a state of ignorant bliss, oblivious to the evils that lurked like frothy-mouthed predators outside the imaginary gates of our small Amish community. The English world with its mysterious and forbidden charms seemed like a million miles away from our perfect little corner of the earth. I had no way of knowing that some predators come from within and beauty has absolutely nothing to do with the crimes men commit.</p><p>Ohio&#x2019;s Amish country is a mosaic of quaint farms, rolling hills dissected by razor-straight rows of corn, lush hardwood forests, and pastures so green that you&#x2019;d swear you had stepped into a Bill Coleman photograph. This morning, with the sun punching through the final vestiges of fog and the dew sparkling like quicksilver on the tall grass of a hay field, I think of my mamm&#x2019;s words and I understand how she could believe them.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m a cop now and not easily swayed by appearances, no matter how convincing the facade. My name is Kate Burkholder and I&#x2019;ve been the police chief of Painters Mill for about three years now. I was born here to Amish parents in a one-hundred-year-old farmhouse set on sixty acres of northeastern Ohio&#x2019;s rich, glaciated soil. I grew up Plain&#x2014;no electricity, no motorized vehicles. Up until the age of fourteen, I was a typical Amish girl&#x2014;innocent, God-loving, content in the way most Amish children are. My future, my very destiny, had been preordained by my gender and the religion bestowed upon me by my parents. All of that changed on a postcard-perfect summer day much like this one when fate introduced me to the dark side of human nature. I learned at a formative age that even on perfect, sunny days, bad things happen.</p><p>I try not to let my view of the world affect the way I do my job. Most of the time, I succeed. Sometimes I feel all that cynicism pressing in, coloring my perceptions, perhaps unfairly. But far too often, my general distrust of mankind serves me well.</p><p>I&#x2019;m idling down Hogpath Road in my city-issue Explorer with my window down and a to-go cup of coffee between my knees. I&#x2019;ve just come off the graveyard shift, having covered for one of my officers while he visited his folks in Michigan. I&#x2019;m tired, but it&#x2019;s a good tired. The kind that comes with the end of an uneventful shift. No speeders. No domestic disputes. No loose livestock wreaking havoc on the highway. When you&#x2019;ve been a cop for any length of time, you learn to appreciate the small things.</p><p>I&#x2019;m thinking about a hot shower and eight hours of uninterrupted sleep, when my radio crackles. &#x201c;Chief? You there?&#x201d;</p><p>I reach for the mike. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Mona?&#x201d;</p><p>Mona Kurtz is my third-shift dispatcher. She&#x2019;s been part of my small police department from day one, and despite her Lady Gaga-esque wardrobe and decidedly uncoplike manner, she&#x2019;s a good fit. A night owl by nature, she keeps things interesting when the shift is slow&#x2014;which is usually the case&#x2014;but when the situation calls for it, she&#x2019;s all business and a true benefit to the department.</p><p>&#x201c;I just took a nine one one for some kind of disturbance,&#x201d; she tells me.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the twenty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Covered bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>Images of drunk and disorderly teenagers flash in my mind&#x2019;s eye and I groan inwardly. The Tuscarawas Bridge is a favorite hangout for some of the local youths to &#x201c;chill.&#x201d; As of late, some of that so-called chilling has deteriorated to other unsavory activities, like underage drinking, fighting, and drug use&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m sure that&#x2019;s just the tip of the iceberg. A week ago, one of my officers busted the mayor&#x2019;s seventeen-year-old son with an ounce of weed and a meth pipe. The mayor hasn&#x2019;t spoken to me since. But I know the conversation is coming. Probably in the form of a request I won&#x2019;t be able to grant.</p><p>I glance at the clock on my dash and restrain a sigh. Eight A.M. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re starting early.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or staying late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who called it in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Randy Trask was on his way to work and said there was some kind of ruckus.&#x201d;</p><p>Muttering beneath my breath, I swing right, hang a U-turn in the middle of the road, and hit the accelerator. &#x201c;Is Trask still there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He left, Chief. Had to get to work.&#x201d;</p><p>I sigh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ten-seventy-six.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;</p><p>The Tuscarawas covered bridge is a Painters Mill icon and of substantial historical significance. It was built in 1868, fell to ruin during the Depression, and was refurbished at the expense of the taxpayers and a donation from the Painters Mill Historical Society in 1981. Constructed of wood and painted barn red, it spans 125 feet across Painters Creek. The bridge is a tourist attraction and has been the topic of many a town council meeting, mainly due to the fact that a few local graffiti artistes have declared it fair game&#x2014;and my department has yet to catch a single one. It&#x2019;s located on a little-used asphalt road that cuts through bottomland that&#x2019;s prone to flooding in the spring. The surrounding woods are dense with century-old hardwood trees and a summer&#x2019;s growth of underbrush&#x2014;the perfect locale for a multitude of illicit activities.</p><p>It takes me five minutes to reach the bridge. I slow as I approach its yawning red mouth. To my right, I can just make out a footpath cut into the forest, and I know there have been plenty of people hoofing it down to the creek bank to fish or swim or whatever the hell it is they do there.</p><p>A jacked-up Chevy Nova with wide tires and a spoiler at the rear is parked on the gravel turnout, its oxidized paint glinting dully in the morning sun. Next to it, an ancient Bonneville with a patchwork of Bondo on the front quarter panel squats on the shoulder like some armored dinosaur. The driver&#x2019;s side door is open and the coarse echo of techno-rock booms out so loudly, my windows vibrate. I see two more cars parked on the other side of the bridge. I peer ahead and see, cloaked in the shadows of the covered bridge, the silhouettes of a couple of dozen young people grouped into a tight circle.</p><p>I pulse my siren a couple of times to get their attention. Some look my way. Others are so embroiled in whatever&#x2019;s going on, they don&#x2019;t even notice. Or maybe they don&#x2019;t care.</p><p>I park behind the Nova, shut down the engine, and hail Mona. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ten-twenty-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on out there, Chief?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d lay odds on a fight.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve just opened my door, when a scream echoes from within the bridge. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; I mutter. &#x201c;Is Glock there yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just walked in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get him out here, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten-four.&#x201d;</p><p>Racking the mike, I slip out of the car and hit the ground running. Several of the teens look up and scatter as I approach, and I catch a glimpse of two people on the ground, locked in battle. The agitated crowd throbs around them, shouting, egging them on, as if they&#x2019;ve bet their life savings on some bloody dogfight.</p><p>&#x201c;Police!&#x201d; I shout, my boots crisp against the wood planks. &#x201c;Back off ! Break it up! Right now!&#x201d;</p><p>Faces turn my way. Some are familiar; most are not. I see flashes of surprise in young eyes alight with something a little too close to bloodlust. Cruelty in its most primal form. Pack mentality, I realize, and that disturbs me almost as much as the fight.</p><p>I thrust myself into the crowd, using my forearms to move people aside. &#x201c;Step away! Now!&#x201d;</p><p>A teenage boy with slumped shoulders and a raw-looking outbreak of acne on his cheeks glances at me and takes a step back. Another boy is so caught up in the fight, he doesn&#x2019;t notice my approach and repeatedly jabs the air with his fist, chanting, &#x201c;Beat that bitch!&#x201d; A black-haired girl wearing a purple halter top that&#x2019;s far too small for her bustline lands a kick at one of the fighters. &#x201c;Break her face, you fuckin&#x2019; ho!&#x201d;</p><p>I elbow past two boys not much bigger than I am, and I get my first unobstructed look at the epicenter of the chaos. Two teenage girls are going at it with the no-holds-barred frenzy of veteran barroom brawlers. Hands grapple with clothes and hair. Nails slash at faces. I hear animalistic grunts, the sound of ripping fabric, and the wet-meat slap of fists connecting with flesh.</p><p>&#x201c;Get off me, bitch!&#x201d;</p><p>I bend, slam my hands down on the shoulders of the girl on top. &#x201c;Police,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Stop fighting.&#x201d;</p><p>She&#x2019;s a big-boned girl and outweighs me by about twenty pounds. Moving her is like trying to peel a starving lion off a fresh kill. When she doesn&#x2019;t acquiesce, I dig my fingers into her collarbone, put some muscle into it, and haul her back. &#x201c;Stop resisting!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get off me!&#x201d; Blinded by rage, the girl tries to shake off my hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to kill this bitch!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not on my watch.&#x201d; I put my body weight into the effort and yank her back hard. Her shirt tears beneath my hands. She reels backward and lands on her butt at my feet. She tries to get her legs under her, but I press her down.</p><p>&#x201c;Calm down.&#x201d; I give her a shake to let her know I&#x2019;m serious.</p><p>Ignoring me, she crab-walks forward and lashes out at the other girl with her foot, trying to get in a final kick. I wrap my hands around her bicep and drag her back several feet. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough!

Solid research at the elementary level shows how to help all students become mathematically proficient by redefining what it means to compute with number sense. Pam Harris has spent the past ten years scrutinizing the research and using the resulting reform materials with teachers and students, seeing what works and what doesn't work, always with an eye to success in higher math. This book brings these insights to the secondary world, with an emphasis on one powerful goal: building numeracy.</p> <p>Developing numeracy in today's middle and high school students is reflective of the Common Core State Standards mission to build "the skills that our young people need for success in college and careers." (CCSS 2010) Numeracy is more than the ability to do basic arithmetic. At its heart, numeracy is the ability to use mathematical relationships to reason with numbers and numerical concepts, to think through the math logically, to have a repertoire of strategies to solve problems, and to be able to apply the logic outside of classrooms. </p> <p>How can we build powerful numeracy in middle and secondary students? Harris's approach emphasizes two big ideas:</p> <ul> <li>Teach the importance of representation. The representation of student strategies on models such as the open number line, the open array, and the ratio table promote discussion on relationships rather than procedures </li> <li>Teach with problem strings. Introduced by Catherine Twomey Fosnot and her colleagues in the <em>Young Mathematicians at Work</em> series, problem strings are purposefully designed sequences of related problems that help students construct numerical relationships. They encourage students to look to the numbers first before choosing a strategy, nudging them toward efficient, sophisticated strategies for computation.</li> </ul> <p>Understanding numerical relationships gives students the freedom to choose a strategy, rather than being stuck with only one way to solve a problem. Using the strings and activities in this book can empower your students to reason through problems and seek to find clever solutions. They'll become more naturally inclined to use the strategies that make sense to them. Students become engaged, willing to think, and more confident in their justifications. When we give secondary students this numerical power, we also help them learn higher mathematics with more confidence and more success.</p></p><p><p>Pamela Weber Harris, a former secondary mathematics teacher, is a K-12 mathematics education consultant, a T^3 (Teachers Teaching with Technology) National Instructor, and a nationally known speaker.

(The School of Life Library)</h2><p>Typically, great thinkers have been included in encyclopedic works on the basis of reputation and historic influence. The School of Life takes a different approach, focusing instead on the thinkers whose ideas are the most helpful to our lives now. This is a collection of sixty of the most important and most useful ideas of Eastern and Western culture. The focus of this book is to present some of the greatest minds of our time in a clear, relevant and charming light. Many of these thinkers have previously been caught in a fiendish trap; what they&#x2019;ve said has been hugely relevant and important, but how they have said it has resulted in them going unheard. The sixty chosen thinkers include La Rochefoucauld, Lao Tzu, Matsuo Basho, Sen no Rikyu, Alexis de Tocqueville, St Benedict, Donald Winnicott, John Bowlby, Melanie Klein, Andrea Palladio, Coco Chanel, Henri Matisse; as well as more familiar entries such as Plato, Wittgenstein, Foucault, Marx, Confucius and Freud.</p><p><p><strong>The School of Life</strong> is a global organization helping people lead more fulfilled lives.

He grew up to be arguably the most influential philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like &#x2018;the master&#x2019;, and simply &#x2018;the philosopher&#x2019;. One of his big jobs was tutoring Alexander the Great, who soon after went out and conquered the known world. Aristotle studied in Athens, worked with Plato for several years, and then branched out on his own. He founded a research and teaching centre called The Lyceum: French secondary schools, lyc�es, are named in honour of this venture. He liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were named Peripatetics, the wanderers. His many books are actually lecture notes. Aristotle was fascinated by how things really work. How does an embryo chick develop in an egg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place and hardly at all in another? And, most importantly, what makes a human life and a whole society go well? For Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom. Here are four big philosophical questions he answered: 1. What makes people happy? In the Nicomachean Ethics &#x2013; the book got its name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus &#x2013; Aristotle set himself the task of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life, or not. He suggested that good and successful people all possess distinct virtues, and proposed that we should get better at identifying what these are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle also observed that every virtue seems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed &#x2018;the golden mean&#x2019; between two extremes of character. For example, in book four of his Ethics, under the charming title of &#x2018;conversational virtues and vices&#x2019;, Aristotle looks at ways in which people are better or worse at talking to one another &#x2013; buffoonery, wit, boorishness. Knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the key ingredients of the good life, Aristotle recognised. Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle sense of humour: that&#x2019;s the bore, &#x2018;someone useless for any kind of social intercourse, because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything&#x2019;. But others carry humour to excess: &#x2018;the buffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself nor anybody else, provided that he can raise a laugh and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying&#x2019;. So the virtuous person is in the golden mean in this area: witty but tactful. In a fascinating survey of personality and behaviour, Aristotle analyses &#x2018;too little&#x2019;, &#x2018;too much&#x2019; and &#x2018;just right&#x2019; around a whole host of virtues. We can&#x2019;t change our behaviour in any of these areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. Moral goodness, says Aristotle, is the result of habit. It takes time, practice, encouragement. So Aristotle thinks people who lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate, rather than wicked. What they need isn&#x2019;t scolding or being thrown into prison, but better teachers and more guidance. 2. What is art for? The blockbuster art at the time was tragedy. Athenians watched gory plays at community festivals held at huge open-air theatres. Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a how-to-write-great-plays manual, The Poetics. It&#x2019;s packed with great tips: for example, make sure to use peripeteia, a change in fortune, when, for the hero, things go from great to awful. And anagnorisis, the moment of dramatic revelation, when suddenly the hero realises their life is going very wrong &#x2013; and is, in fact, a catastrophe. But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together to watch horrible things happening to lead characters? Like Oedipus, in the play by Sophocles, who by accident kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he&#x2019;s done these things and gouges out his eyes in remorse and despair. Aristotle&#x2019;s answer is catharsis. Catharsis is a kind of cleaning: you get rid of bad stuff. In this case, cleaning up our emotions &#x2013; specifically, our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity. We&#x2019;ve got natural problems here: we&#x2019;re hard-hearted, we don&#x2019;t give pity where it&#x2019;s deserved, and we&#x2019;re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough. Tragedy reminds us that terrible things can befall decent people, including ourselves. A small flaw can lead to a whole life unravelling. So we should have more compassion or pity for those whose actions go disastrously wrong. We need to be collectively retaught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art, as Aristotle saw it, is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds. 3. What are friends for? In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship: there&#x2019;s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun, their chief interest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment, which the other person provides. Then there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances, where people take pleasure in each other&#x2019;s company only in so far as they have hopes of taking advantage of it. Then, there&#x2019;s the true friend. Not someone who&#x2019;s just like you, but someone who isn&#x2019;t you, and about whom you care as much as you care about yourself. The sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows. Their joys are yours. It makes you more vulnerable, should anything befall this person. But it&#x2019;s hugely strengthening too. You&#x2019;re relieved from the too-small orbit of your own thoughts and worries. You expand into the life of another, and together you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair-minded. You share virtues and cancel out each other&#x2019;s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be: it is, quite literally, the best part of life. 4. How can ideas cut through in a busy world? Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck by the fact that the best argument doesn&#x2019;t always win the debate or gain popular traction. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations. In Athens, many decisions were made in public meetings, often in the agora, the town square. Orators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion. Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals are influenced by many factors but don&#x2019;t strictly engage with logic or the facts of the case. It&#x2019;s maddening, and many serious people can&#x2019;t stand it. They avoid the marketplace and popular debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented what we still call rhetoric &#x2013; the art of getting people to agree with you. He wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive, to reach those who don&#x2019;t agree already. He makes some timeless points: you have to soothe people&#x2019;s fears, you have to see the emotional side of the issue &#x2013; is someone&#x2019;s pride on the line? Are they feeling embarrassed? &#x2013; and edge around it accordingly. You have to make it funny because attention spans are short, and you might have to use illustrations and examples to make your point come alive. We&#x2019;re keen students of Aristotle. Today, philosophy doesn&#x2019;t sound like the most practical activity; maybe that&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;ve not paid enough attention recently to Aristotle.</p><h2>The Running Revolution: How to Run Faster, Farther, and Injury-Free--for Life</h2><p><b>From a two-time Olympic coach and creator of the Pose Method who has trained the running elite, an essential guide for all runners seeking to go faster and farther without injury</b><br><br> Christopher McDougall&#x2019;s <i>Born to Run</i>&#x2014;and the wildly popular natural running trend it sparked&#x2014;changed the way we think about running, but it has also prompted many questions: Have we been running the wrong way?

In fact at fifty-two years of age I am still improving. A bonus of the Pose Method for me has been significant health and strength improvement. My journey has been patient and progressive and had I continued to run as I did previously I believe I would now be limited to playing board games. My advice is to be patient and persevere; it truly is worth it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x2014;Terry Roberts, twenty-eight time Ironman finisher and Ironman Australia legend</p><p>&#x201c;I have used these principles to develop running skill in U.S. Army Soldiers since 2008 and have seen decreases of up to four minutes on a two-mile run within just two weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Dr. Charles Blake, U.S. Army Major and physical therapist</p><p>&#x201c;About one year ago, I could not run fifty yards without extreme IT Band Syndrome pain. I spent thirty minutes with Dr. Romanov and could run as far and as much as I wanted pain free. Today, I am the USA Paratriathlon National Champion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;David Kyle, associate director of health and physical education, University of Alabama</p><p>&#x201c;The material and insights detailed in The Running Revolution are scientifically, physically, and emotionally profound. The Pose Method has the potential to be used as a standard by which running performances can be evaluated, coached, and enhanced. If you are a runner looking for a resource to reduce injury risk, improve performance, and build your training program, look no further. In twenty-five years of working with running athletes, I have yet to find a more meaningful resource.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Tom Whipple, physical therapist, Penn State Sports Medicine, and author of The Endurance Paradox</p><p>&#x201c;Romanov&#x2019;s teachings have dramatically changed and fundamentally shaped the way we think about, understand, and teach not only running, but all movement. I can say unequivocally that no other information I have acquired in my career has influenced my teaching process more. The Pose Method is the only teaching method we use for our runners at La Palestra.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Pat Manocchia, former Good Morning America fitness expert and founder of La Palestra Center for Preventative Medicine</p><p>&#x201c;To tens of thousands of runners, including me, Nicholas Romanov walks (and runs) on water. Approaching running as a skill to be learned, his groundbreaking, much-copied Pose Method established a new paradigm, promoting a soft, natural landing that minimizes impact, maximizes speed, eliminates injuries, and saves running careers. No one thought about form until Romanov came along; now we know that it is crucial. I&#x2019;ve interviewed dozens of runners who simply would not be running without it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Roy M. Wallack, author of Barefoot Running Step by Step and Run for Life</p><p>&#x201c;The Pose Method of running has been a crucial component of my physical therapy practice. Not only does this method offer a clear standard for teaching and modifying running form, it also allows runners to run more efficiently. I instruct my patients in the Pose Method before allowing them to run again. Since adopting this practice I have seen patients who were unable to run for years not only start running again, but do so pain free. Other patients have shaved one to two minutes, on average, off their two-mile Army Physical Fitness Test run times. Since learning the Pose Method, I have personally dropped my half marathon time by ten minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Major Angela Diebal, U.S. Army physical therapist</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no doubt about it, the Pose Method made me a more efficient runner. And the beauty of the system is that no matter who you are, if you stick to the principles and apply them in each training session, you can&#x2019;t help but improve.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Andrew Walters, elite Australian Marathoner, Pose Method coach, and founder of Setai-Do Australia</p><p>&#x201c;I discovered Dr. Romanov&#x2019;s Pose Method about four years ago, and it has changed the way I understand running. Since then both my athletes and I have gained the ability to run great distances with less stress on the body, faster recovery, and reduced running-related injuries. This book will help transform you into a smoother, more confident athlete.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Gil Cramer, running technique specialist and elite ultra marathoner</p><p>&#x201c;Movement skill is foundational for the performance community. Dr. Romanov brings the same approach to running. Romanov&#x2019;s Running Revolution is the common standard upon which running skill can be built.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Major David Feltwell, U.S. Army physical therapist</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Romanov has spent the majority of his life thinking about running problems and in close to one day the solutions came to him: Pose Method. I am overwhelmed by gratitude when I ponder how much time Dr. Romanov has invested into solving many of the running problems we have not understood in the past.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Debbie Savage, strength and conditioning coach, Australian Sports Commission, and former elite sprinter</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE RUNNING REVOLUTION</p><p>DR.

He lives in High Falls, New York, with his wife and stepson.</p>George has again taken a microscope to a typical day in a natural region. An Indian boy leads a scientist who is trying to locate a previously unknown butterfly that the scientist hopes will halt the destruction of this particular rain forest. At the same time, a horde of army ants moves across the forest floor; a sloth comes down from a tree for its weekly visit; and other animals go about their daily business. Such ordinary happenings make an exciting sequence of events that holds readers' attention as they also learn facts about the flora and fauna of the rain forest. There may not be enough material here for a report, but the book is an example of nonfiction writing at its best, for readers learn facts and get a sense of the rain forest in diary form rather than straight factual writing. The description of the relationship between the destruction of the rain forest and the greenhouse effect is easy to understand, and the index helps readers wanting specific facts. The drawings are clear, but do not expand the textual information. --Margaret C. Howell, West Springfield Elem .

Audra is so strong, so different than the &#x201c;rescue me&#x201d; variety of heroines out there. Where does her strength come from? To be blunt, is she you, in awesome book form?</p> <p> <strong>Shannon Messenger:</strong> Ha&#x2014;I wish! I&#x2019;d love to claim that I&#x2019;m as brave and tough as Audra is, but anyone who&#x2019;s ever seen me around a spider would totally call me out. :) I guess the one thing we do have in common is that we&#x2019;re both really stubborn, and in Audra&#x2019;s case I feel like that&#x2019;s where a lot of her strength comes from. When she sets her mind to something, she <i>will</i> make it happen. She&#x2019;s also the most broken character I&#x2019;ve ever written, and yet those fears and insecurities are what push her to be stronger, fight harder, and always stand up for what she believes.</p> <p><strong>HB:</strong> Vane. Can we talk about Vane, please?? He&#x2019;s precisely the kind of charming rebel that so many readers swoon over. *cough* Yours truly. *cough* Who was the inspiration, if anyone...and can we all date him?</p> <p><strong>SM:</strong> Awww, I&#x2019;m so glad you love Vane! He&#x2019;s one of my favorite characters to write&#x2014;though, I&#x2019;ll admit, he can also make me want to shout at the screen, &#x201c;Will you stop hitting on Audra and focus?&#x201d; (Side note: yes, my characters are probably too real to me...) And honestly, half the time when I reread his chapters I think, <i>Where did that come from???</i> But that&#x2019;s what I love best about him. He&#x2019;s such a <i>boy</i>. And he feels real. He&#x2019;s a guy who could easily be sitting next to you in your class, or in line in front of you at In-N-Out. Just, you know, with the power to control the wind. And better abs. ;)</p> <p><strong>HB:</strong> There are so many books out there that focus on the paranormal, it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd. <i>Let The Sky Fall</i> totally does! What gave you the unique idea to write about sylphs?</p> <p><strong>SM:</strong>I stumbled across sylphs when I was doing research for my middle-grade series, Keeper of the Lost Cities. They caught my attention because they had very little existing lore, so I could pretty much make up whatever I wanted. And I&#x2019;ve always been fascinated by the wind. I love how it can be a refreshing breeze on a hot day or a tornado destroying an entire town&#x2014;and everything in between. Once I started thinking about what it would be like to have that kind of power, the characters sprang to life and refused to go away. I finally gave in one night at four a.m., dragged myself out of bed, and started writing their story. They&#x2019;ve been bossing me around ever since.</p> <p><strong>HB:</strong> Audra really shoulders some huge responsibilities as Vane&#x2019;s guardian, and together they face daunting challenges. Can you speak to this personally as it pertains to the writing and publishing process?</p> <p><strong>SM:</strong> Wait&#x2014;is getting published daunting? Nobody told me!!! No, I hope you&#x2019;re picking up my sarcasm, because getting published was *quite* the process. I spent nearly four years writing <i>Keeper of the Lost Cities</i>, and the final published version is actually draft twenty. (Yes, <i>twenty!</i>) That&#x2019;s why <i>Let The Sky Fall</i> started out as my &#x201c;sanity project.&#x201d; Whenever I&#x2019;d get to the point where I wanted to throw my laptop into the street and back over it with my car, I&#x2019;d take a break from revision and play with Vane and Audra until I fell back in love with writing again. I think that&#x2019;s the most important thing when you&#x2019;re trying to get published: do it because you love it.</p> <p><strong>HB:</strong> Okay, let&#x2019;s get down to it. Who would win in a slap fight: Kaya from Legacy of Tril or Audra from <i>Let the Sky Fall</i>?</p> <p><strong>SM:</strong> Hm, that&#x2019;s a tricky one, because we both know that with these girls, the slap fight would very quickly turn into a sword fight&#x2014;or, I should say, a katana vs. windslicer fight&#x2014;and they both have some mad skills with a blade. I&#x2019;m pretty sure the fight would end in a draw. But it would be <i>awesome</i> to watch!</p> <p><strong>HB:</strong> What&#x2019;s next for my new favorite characters? Will there be more books about Audra and Vane (best name EVER, by the way)?</p> <p><strong>SM:</strong> Aw, thank you! And yes, there will be more books! I don&#x2019;t want to spoil anything for anyone, so I won&#x2019;t get into any specifics. But I will say: there will be kissing! (one must have priorities, after all...) We&#x2019;re also going to see a lot more of the sylphs&#x2019; world, and meet some really cool new characters, and brave some pretty epic wind battles. Basically I&#x2019;m doing everything I can to make sure the next books blow everyone away!

Setting a precedent as First Lady, Betty Ford refused to be silenced by her critics as she publicly championed equal rights for women, and spoke out about issues that had previously been taboo&#x2014;breast cancer, depression, abortion, and sexuality. Privately, there were signs something was wrong. After a painful intervention by her family, she admitted to an addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. Her courageous decision to speak out publicly sparked a national dialogue, and in 1982, she co-founded the Betty Ford Center, which revolutionized treatment for alcoholism and inspired the modern concept of recovery.<br> <br>Lisa McCubbin also brings to light Gerald and Betty Ford&#x2019;s sweeping love story: from Michigan to the White House, until their dying days, their relationship was that of a man and woman utterly devoted to one another other&#x2014;a relationship built on trust, respect, and an unquantifiable chemistry.<br> <br>Based on intimate interviews with her children, Susan Ford Bales and Steven Ford, as well as family, friends, and colleagues, <i>Betty Ford </i>is &#x201c;a vivid picture of a singularly influential woman&#x201d; (<i>Bookpage</i>).</p><p>Lisa McCubbin is the coauthor of four <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>Five Presidents</i>; <i>Mrs. Kennedy and Me</i>; <i>Five Days in November</i>; and<i> The Kennedy Detail</i>.

She would break into one of her contagious smiles, and with a glint of mischief in her eyes, she&#x2019;d add, &#x201c;I think I was an accident; the result of an unplanned party.&#x201d;<br> <br>Actually, Elizabeth Anne Bloomer came into the world at Lake View Hospital in Chicago on April 8, 1918, the third child born to Hortense Neahr Bloomer and William Stephenson Bloomer. Her two brothers, Bill and Bob, were seven and five, respectively, at the time of her birth, and it was that five-year spread, along with the fact that her mother was in her early thirties, that had her wondering whether she was a surprise addition to the family. Whatever the circumstances of her conception, the round-faced baby girl with sparkling blue eyes made the family complete.<br> <br>Elizabeth was her given name, but perhaps it was just too formal for the bubbly personality that developed&#x2014;or perhaps her mother always intended to shorten it to match the B names of her brothers&#x2014;but as far back as she could remember, everyone called her &#x201c;Betty&#x201d; or &#x201c;Bets.&#x201d;<br> <br>A few months after Betty was born, the Bloomers moved from Chicago to Denver, Colorado, where William Bloomer had accepted a job as district sales manager for the Republic Rubber Corporation. After more than twenty years in the rubber industry, William had earned a good reputation selling conveyor belts&#x2014;previously for the B. F. Goodrich Company&#x2014;and by this point, he was earning a comfortable living.<br> <br>The Bloomers rented a large house in the prestigious Capitol Heights neighborhood and hired a live-in maid, a German woman, to help Hortense manage the household. The house at 1410 Josephine Street was nestled in a row of similarly grand homes owned or rented by families of comparable status, all with sprawling front porches facing a tree-lined sidewalk.<br> <br>While Hortense appeared to enjoy life in Denver, just before Betty turned two, William switched jobs again, this time taking a position at the Quaker City Rubber Company, which was based in Chicago. This would be the fourth move in less than four years&#x2014;they&#x2019;d been in Seattle prior to the short stint in Chicago when Betty was born&#x2014;and since William would be traveling all over the Midwest, a decision was made to settle in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Hortense had a cousin. This would be the last move, and for Betty, Grand Rapids would be where her childhood memories began.<br> <br>The city of Grand Rapids lies along the Grand River, some thirty miles east of Lake Michigan, and by the time the Bloomers arrived in the winter of 1920, the city was home to a booming furniture industry, with a variety of immigrants making up the population. Known as &#x201c;Furniture City,&#x201d; Grand Rapids was one of the country&#x2019;s major manufacturing hubs: a bustling midsize city with a state-of-the-art electric trolley system. For a nickel, you could ride the electric streetcars throughout the downtown area or out to Ramona Park&#x2014;an amusement park on Reeds Lake that was famous for its double-track wooden roller coaster and outdoor entertainment pavilion.<br> <br>The Grand River flowed from north to south, dividing Grand Rapids in half, and in the 1920s, it segregated the city by income levels and, to some extent, ethnicity. The furniture factories stood along the river, and the men who worked in them tended to live in the small homes that had been built in residential neighborhoods on the west side, while the mill owners and businessmen lived on the east side in grand neighborhoods with ornate mansions. The citizens of Grand Rapids held tight to traditional values, were largely churchgoers&#x2014;in 1920 there were 134 churches in the city&#x2014;and had overwhelmingly embraced prohibition of alcohol, banning all bars, saloons, and taverns nearly two years before it was required by the Eighteenth Amendment.<br> <br>The Bloomers moved into a two-story wood-frame house at 717 Fountain Street in an affluent, predominantly Dutch east-side neighborhood where people took pride in their homes and yards. It wasn&#x2019;t a large house&#x2014;not nearly as big as the one in Denver&#x2014;but it had enough bedrooms and a separate one-car garage in back that was accessible by an alleyway. Betty would remember the house as being &#x201c;filled with light&#x201d; and that she was happy there.<br> <br>Hortense&#x2019;s cousin Charlotte Neahr Irwin and her husband, Earle, lived nearby with their two children: a son named Bill and a daughter named Charlotte, whom everyone called &#x201c;Shine.&#x201d; With William Bloomer traveling so much, it was nice for Hortense to have family close by and for her children to grow up around cousins.<br> <br>Because the Grand Rapids winters were so long and cold, by the time spring came around, many well-to-do families flocked to the lakes, eager to make the most of the few months of warmth and sunshine. The Bloomers found a place called Hartt&#x2019;s Resort on Whitefish Lake, in Pierson, Michigan, about thirty miles due north of Grand Rapids, where you could rent a lakeside cottage for $10 a week. It was a tight-knit community in which the same families came back year after year, the kind of place where children made lifelong friends with shared memories of carefree days. The day after school let out, the Bloomers would pack up the family&#x2019;s Cole Eight touring car, and Hortense and the children would stay for the entire summer, with William joining them when he could take time off.<br> <br>Betty had a Dutch-boy bob haircut that was popular at the time and a happy personality that attracted people to her. The first summer at the lake, she realized she could wander around the picnic grounds, and if she stopped at each table, someone would invariably offer a cookie or piece of cake. It became such a habit that she was growing chubbier by the week, prompting Hortense to hang a sign on her back that said &#x201c;Please do not feed this child.&#x201d;<br> <br>The resort had a safe bathing beach with a long L-shaped dock down the middle, and cool, clear water that was shallow enough so even the younger children could wade in up to their knees for a good distance before it got too deep. Boys and girls of varying ages romped around together, spending hours and hours in and out of the water, making up games and competitions&#x2014;swimming, sailing, canoeing, and fishing from the dock with bamboo poles&#x2014;their fair skin turning browner and browner as the summer days seemingly went on forever.<br> <br>When Betty&#x2019;s father joined the family at the lake, he would take out a rowboat and fish for hours. &#x201c;He was a great fisherman,&#x201d; she recalled. &#x201c;He spent his entire vacation fishing, and we were served fish and fish and fish until I hoped I would never see fish again.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a simpler time, when children would leave the house in the morning and run around the neighborhood inventing games and finding ways to entertain themselves. Betty adored her two older brothers, and she trailed after them, constantly trying to be part of whatever activity they were doing. By her own admission, she was a &#x201c;terrible tomboy,&#x201d; and it was thanks to her brothers that she learned how to properly throw a football and play ice hockey. When the two of them would get into fights&#x2014;as brothers do&#x2014;she&#x2019;d get right down on the floor with them, trying to pull off the one who was on top. It didn&#x2019;t make any difference which one was on top, she was always rooting for the guy on the bottom, and she had no qualms about getting right there in the thick of things.<br> <br>As soon as she was old enough, Betty walked with her brothers to Fountain Street Elementary School. On one of her first days in kindergarten, someone noticed a blemish on her left hand and began teasing her about it. It was a birthmark that she&#x2019;d never paid any attention to, but soon a whole group of kids were making fun of her. She was mortified to be made to feel such an outcast, and when she got home and saw her mother, she burst into tears.<br> <br>Through the sobs, Betty explained how the other children had been so cruel and how embarrassed she was to have this mark on her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, dear Betty,&#x201d; Hortense said, as she swept her daughter into her arms, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t you realize? You are the only little girl in the world with a birthmark like that. It makes you special, and most importantly, because of that mark, no matter where you go, I will never lose you.&#x201d; The next day, Betty returned to school filled with pride and a newfound sense of confidence.<br> <br>Even though Betty loved sports and could hold her own with her brothers, Hortense was determined to make a young lady out of her. From the time Betty could walk, her mother insisted she wear a hat and gloves whenever they went downtown, and she was a stickler for proper manners. She was particular about table manners: napkin in the lap, using the proper utensils, and chewing with your mouth closed. &#x201c;You sound just like a horse,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say if Betty was chomping on an apple. &#x201c;Go into the kitchen or go to your room. I don&#x2019;t want to hear it.&#x201d;<br> <br>As a traveling salesman, William Bloomer would be gone weeks at a time, but Hortense kept him apprised of what was going on in the family through daily letters. Every evening, Betty would come downstairs after finishing her homework and see her mother sitting at the desk writing to her father. When he came home after a long trip, he&#x2019;d always bring something for Betty, and over the years of her childhood, she amassed a cornucopia of stuffed animals. Her favorite was a teddy bear that she dragged everywhere as a little girl, but the gifts didn&#x2019;t make up for her dad being gone so often, and she vowed to herself that she&#x2019;d never marry a man who traveled.<br> <br>With William gone so much of the time, Hortense basically raised Betty and her brothers as a single mother. She was warm and loving, but she taught her children to know right from wrong, tending to teach through humor rather than pressure. Spankings in the household were rare, but the threat of a hairbrush on the bottom was always there.<br> <br>When Betty was eight years old, her mother enrolled her in dance lessons.<br> <br>About five blocks away from the Bloomer house, an unmarried woman named Calla Travis had transformed her home at 220 Fulton Street into the Miss Calla Travis School of Dancing. It was a big Victorian house with high ceilings, beautiful wood floors, and large rooms that were empty except for dozens of wood-slat folding chairs backed up against the walls. Miss Travis held classes upstairs and downstairs for &#x201c;every phase of dance art&#x201d;&#x2014;ballroom, ballet, tap, Latin dancing, and even acrobatic&#x2014;and while she taught many of the lessons herself, she also used previous graduates as instructors. Betty&#x2019;s first class was social ballroom dancing, with the boys, in jackets and ties, sitting on one side of the room, and the girls, in white socks, black patent leather Mary Janes, and white gloves, sitting on the other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies!&#x201d; Calla Travis would call out as she clapped her hands, &#x201c;You sit with your legs crossed!&#x201d;<br> <br>The boys would stride across the room to ask a girl to be their partner, and they&#x2019;d dance the waltz and fox-trot in time to Calla&#x2019;s clattering castanets. Betty loved it so much, she persuaded her mother to send her to Calla&#x2019;s studio for more classes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I signed up for everything,&#x201d; Betty wrote in her memoir. &#x201c;I adored it all. Dance was my happiness.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was on her very first day at Miss Calla&#x2019;s that she met Lilian Fisher, another eight-year-old, who lived a few miles out of town. Their birthdays were just two months apart, and the girls became instant friends. It was a friendship that would last their entire lives.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was pretty,&#x201d; Lilian said. &#x201c;Just pretty . . . and she wasn&#x2019;t too tall, and she could kick. She could pirouette and do all these crazy things.&#x201d;<br> <br>Each spring, Miss Calla put on a show featuring all her students. It was an impressive production with elaborate sets, props, and costumes, held in the St. Cecilia&#x2019;s Society building, which had a big stage and plenty of auditorium seating for the parents and families of the aspiring young dancers. In her debut performance, Betty was skipping around the stage with a group of girls, each of them holding tin buckets meant to look like flower baskets. Betty lost her grip, the bucket went rattling down toward the footlights, making a terrible racket, and the audience roared with laughter. For someone with less confidence, such an incident might have put them off performing for good, but not Betty. She loved being onstage. More important, she just loved to dance.<br> <br>Every afternoon, right after school, Betty would head straight to the dance studio. Her report cards from middle school and high school show that she struggled to get average grades in the standard subjects, but when it came to dance, she was a perfectionist. She never tired of practicing and read voraciously about different methods and prominent dancers from around the world. She took every class Miss Travis offered, with the goal of becoming a dance instructor herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was no kind of dance that didn&#x2019;t fascinate me,&#x201d; Betty wrote. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hear about some boy who&#x2019;d been out west among the Indians and learned a rain dance, and I&#x2019;d go to him and make him teach it to me. I was insatiable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Calla Travis had developed a rigorous and specific &#x201c;Graded System of Dance Instruction,&#x201d; and you had to be able to perform every move perfectly to progress to the next level. At first, it was ballet that Betty adored most of all, and she dreamt of going to New York City to become a ballerina. But the movements and positions were so precise, and she couldn&#x2019;t seem to get her knees straight enough to appease Miss Travis. To pass the ballet course, Betty cleverly realized that if she designed her own costume, she could wear a flowy skirt made with scarves hanging down to camouflage whether her knees were straight or bent.<br> <br>A few years into Betty&#x2019;s dance instruction, Miss Calla returned from a visit to the University of Wisconsin, where she had learned about something new called the Dalcroze method. This method taught concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, which came to be known as eurythmics. It was Betty&#x2019;s first introduction to modern dance, and she loved the idea of experiencing music through the body as a means of self-expression. Gone were her dreams of being a prima ballerina&#x2014;her new passion was modern dance.<br> <br>Hortense encouraged Betty&#x2019;s interest in dance, but she also strived to teach her daughter humility and charity. Mrs. Bloomer had become active in the Grand Rapids community, joining Junior League&#x2014;the educational and charitable women&#x2019;s group; and volunteering with the Mary Free Bed Guild&#x2014;a women&#x2019;s organization that raised money to provide facilities and care for handicapped and crippled children. From a young age, Betty accompanied her mother to the Mary Free Bed convalescent home, where she&#x2019;d see children her own age who were confined to wheelchairs, or had legs in braces, their disabilities due to polio or malnutrition.<br> <br>By the time Betty was a teenager, Hortense was guild president, and Betty realized that she could entertain the children by creating a dance party. She would bring in a phonograph, and with the childr...</p><h2>Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory</h2><p><b>Research-based, clinically verified tests help users assess and diagnose students&#x2019; reading abilities (Preprimer - Ninth Grade)</b> <br>The <i> <b>Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory (ESRI) </b> </i>features forty diagnostic tests to help educators, school psychologists, resource teachers, and reading specialists successfully assist individual students in developing their reading ability.

Wouldn't it be incredibly lonely? The North route is better! Was it safe for a woman? The Southern route is the way to go! You should bring mace! And a common one... why? But Abbi had always found comfort in solitude, and needed space to step back and hit the reset button. As she spent time in each city and town on her way to Los Angeles, she mulled over the big questions-- What do I really want? What is the worst possible scenario in which I could run into my ex? How has the decision to wear my shirts tucked in been pivotal in my adulthood? <br><br>In this collection of anecdotes, observations and reflections--all told in the sharp, wildly funny, and relatable voice that has endeared Abbi to critics and fans alike--readers will feel like they're in the passenger seat on a fun and, ultimately, inspiring journey.

He is also the author of&nbsp;<i>The Triple Agent</i>.<p>PROLOGUE<br><i>Amman, Jordan, February 3, 2015<br><br></i>Just after nightfall, a warrant arrived at the city&#x2019;s main women&#x2019;s prison for the execution of Sajida al-Rishawi. The instructions had come from King Abdullah II himself, then in Washington on a state visit, and were transmitted from his private plane to the royal court in Jordan&#x2019;s capital. A clerk relayed the message to the Interior Ministry and then to the prisons department, where it caused a stir. State executions are complicated affairs requiring many steps, yet the king&#x2019;s wishes were explicit: the woman would face the gallows before the sun rose the next day.<br><br>The chief warden quickly made the trek to the cell where Rishawi had maintained a kind of self-imposed solitary confinement for close to a decade. The prisoner, forty-five now and no longer thin, spent most of her days watching television or reading a paperback Koran, seeing no one, and keeping whatever thoughts she had under the greasy, prison-issued hijab she always wore. She was not a stupid woman, yet she seemed perpetually disconnected from whatever was going on around her. "When will I be going home?" she asked her government-appointed lawyer during rare meetings in the months after she was sentenced to death. Eventually, even those visits stopped.<br><br>Now, when the warden sat her down to explain that she would die in the morning, Rashida nodded her assent but said nothing. If she cried or prayed or cursed, no one in the prison heard a word of it. <br><br>That she could face death was not a surprise to anyone. In 2006, a judge sentenced Rishawi to hang for her part in Jordan&#x2019;s worst-ever terrorist attack: three simultaneous hotel bombings that killed sixty people, most of them guests at a wedding party. She was the suicide bomber who lived, an odd, heavy-browed woman made to pose awkwardly before TV cameras showing off the vest that had failed to explode. At one time, everyone in Amman knew her story, how this thirty-five-year-old unmarried Iraqi had agreed to wed a stranger so they could become a man-and-wife suicide team; how she panicked and ran; how she had wandered around the city&#x2019;s northern suburbs in a taxi, lost, stopping passersby for directions, still wearing streaks of blood on her clothes and shoes.<br><br>But nearly ten years had passed. The hotels had been rebuilt and renamed, and Rishawi had vanished inside Jordan&#x2019;s labyrinthine penal system. Within the Juwaida Women&#x2019;s Prison, she wore a kind of faded notoriety, like a valuable museum piece that no one looks at anymore. Some of the older hands in the state security service called her "Zarqawi&#x2019;s woman," a mocking reference to the infamous Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who ordered the hotel bombings. The younger ones barely remembered her at all.<br><br>Then, in the span of a month, everything changed. Zarqawi&#x2019;s followers, it turned out, had not forgotten Rishawi. The terrorists had rebranded themselves over the years and were now known in Jordan by the Arabic acronym Daesh&#x2014;in English, ISIS. And in January 2015, ISIS asked to have Rishawi back.<br><br>The demand for her release came in the middle of Jordan&#x2019;s worst domestic crisis in years. A Jordanian air-force jet had crashed in Syria, and its young pilot had been captured alive by ISIS fighters. The group had broadcast photos of the frightened, nearly naked pilot being paraded around by grinning jihadists, some of them reaching out to embrace this great gift that Allah had dropped from the sky.<br><br>From the palace to the security agencies, the king and his advisers steeled themselves for even more awful news. Either the pilot would be publicly butchered by ISIS, they feared, or the terrorists would demand a terrible price for his ransom.<br><br>True to form, ISIS announced its decision in macabre fashion. Less than a week after the crash, the captured pilot&#x2019;s family received a call at home, from the pilot&#x2019;s own cell phone. On the other end, a stranger, speaking in Iraqi-accented Arabic, issued the group&#x2019;s singular demand.<br><i><br>We want our sister Sajida, </i>the caller said.<i><br></i><br>The same demand was repeated, along with several new ones, in a constantly shifting and mostly one-sided negotiation. All the requests were routed to the headquarters of the Mukhabarat, Jordan&#x2019;s intelligence service, and all eventually landed on the desk of the imposing forty-seven-year-old brigadier who ran the department&#x2019;s counterterrorism unit. Even in an agency notorious for its toughness, Abu Haytham stood apart, a man with a burly street fighter&#x2019;s physique and the personality of an anvil. He had battled ISIS in its many incarnations for years, and he had famously broken some of the group&#x2019;s top operatives in interrogation. Zarqawi himself had taken several turns in Abu Haytham&#x2019;s holding cell, and so had Sajida al-Rishawi, the woman ISIS was now seeking to free.<br><br>Outside of Jordan, the demand made little sense. Rishawi had no value as a fighter or a leader, or even as a symbol. She was known to have participated in exactly one terrorist attack, and she had botched it. Hardly "Zarqawi&#x2019;s woman," she had never even met the man who ordered the strike. If ISIS hadn&#x2019;t mentioned her name, she would likely have lived her remaining years quietly in prison, her execution indefinitely deferred for lack of any particular reason to carry it out.<br><br>But Abu Haytham understood. By invoking Rishawi&#x2019;s name, the terrorists were reaching back to the group&#x2019;s beginnings, back to a time before there was an ISIS, or a civil war in Syria; before the meltdown in Iraq that gave rise to the movement; even before the world had heard of a terrorist called Zarqawi. The Mukhabarat&#x2019;s men had tried to keep this terrorist group from gaining a foothold. They had failed&#x2014;sometimes through their own mistakes, more often because of the miscalculations of others. Now, Zarqawi&#x2019;s jihadist movement had become a self-declared state, with territorial claims on two of Jordan&#x2019;s borders. And Rishawi, the failed bomber, was one of many old scores that ISIS was ready to settle.<br><br>In summoning this forgotten ghost, ISIS was evoking one of the most horrifying nights in the country&#x2019;s history, a moment seared into the memories of men of Abu Haytham&#x2019;s generation, the former intelligence captains, investigators, and deputies who had since risen to lead the Mukhabarat. Once, Zarqawi had managed to strike directly at Jordan&#x2019;s heart, and now, with the country&#x2019;s pilot in their hands, ISIS was about to do it again.<br><br>---<br><br>Abu Haytham had been present that night. He could remember every detail of the crime for which Rishawi had been convicted and sentenced to hang. He could remember how the night had felt, the smell of blood and smoke, and the wailing of the injured.<br><br>Mostly he remembered the two girls.<br><br>They were cousins, ages nine and fourteen, and he knew their names: Lina and Riham. Local girls from Amman, out for a wedding party. They were both dressed in white, with small faces that were lovely and pale and perfectly serene. "Just like angels," he had thought.<br><br>They still wore the nearly identical lacy dresses their parents had bought for the party, and stylish shoes for dancing. Almost miraculously, from the neck up neither had suffered a scratch. When Abu Haytham first saw them, lying side by side on a board in those chaotic first moments at the hospital, he had wondered if they were sleeping. Injured, perhaps, but sedated and sleeping. <i>Please, let them be sleeping, </i>he had prayed.<br><br>But then he saw the terrible holes the shrapnel had made.<br><br>The girls would have been standing when it happened, as everyone was, whooping and clapping as the bride and groom prepared to make their entrance in the ballroom at Amman&#x2019;s Radisson Hotel, which was lit up like a desert carnival on a cool mid-November evening. The newlyweds&#x2019; fathers, all big grins and rented tuxedos, had taken their places on the podium, and the Arabic band&#x2019;s bleating woodwinds and throbbing drums had risen to a roar so loud that the hotel clerks in the lobby had to shout to be heard. The party was just reaching its gloriously noisy, sweaty, exuberant peak. No one appeared to have noticed two figures in dark coats who shuffled awkwardly near the doorway and then squeezed between the rows of cheering wedding guests toward the front of the ballroom.<br><br>There was a blinding flash, and then a sensation of everything falling&#x2014;the ceiling, the walls, the floor. The shock wave knocked guests out of their beds on the hotel&#x2019;s upper floors and blew out thick plate-glass doors in the lobby. A thunderclap, then silence. Then screams.<br><br>Only one of the bombs had gone off, but it cut through the ballroom like a swarm of flying razors. Hundreds of steel ball bearings, carefully and densely packed around the bomb&#x2019;s core, sliced through wedding decorations, food trays, and upholstery. They splintered wooden tables and shattered marble tiles. They tore through evening gowns and fancy clutches, through suit jackets and crisp shirts, and through white, frilly dresses of the kind young girls wear to formal parties.<br><br>Abu Haytham, then a captain, was winding down another in a string of long shifts on that Wednesday in early November 2005. It was just before 9:00 p.m. when the first call came in, about an explosion of some kind at the Grand Hyatt across town. The early speculation was that a gas canister was to blame, but then came word of a second blast at the Days Inn Hotel, and then a third&#x2014;reportedly far worse than the others&#x2014;at the Radisson. Abu Haytham knew the place well. It was an Amman landmark, glitzy by Jordanian standards, perched on a hill and easily visible from most of the town, including from his own office building, nearly two miles away.<br><br>He raced to the hotel and pushed his way inside, past the rescue workers, the wailing survivors, and the recovered corpses that had been hauled out on luggage carts and deposited on the driveway. In the ballroom, through a haze of smoke and emergency lights, he could see more bodies. Some were sprawled haphazardly, as though flung by a giant. Others were missing limbs. On the smashed podium lay two crumpled forms in tuxedos. The fathers of both the bride and the groom had been near the bomber and died instantly.<br><br>Abu Haytham assembled teams that worked the three blast sites through the night, gathering whatever remnants they could find of the explosive devices, along with chunks of flesh that constituted the remains of three bombers. Only later, at the hospital, standing over a wooden slab in a makeshift morgue, was he overwhelmed by the horror of the evening: The broken bodies. The scores of wounded. The smell of blood and smoke. The girls, Lina and Riham, lying still in their torn white dresses. Abu Haytham, a doting father, had girls the same age.<br><br>"How," he said aloud, "does someone with a human heart do a thing like this?"<br><br>Just two days later came the news that one of the attackers&#x2014;a woman&#x2014;had survived and fled. A day after that, Sajida al-Rishawi sat in a chair in front of him.<br><br>She would surely know something, tied as she was to such an obviously important and well-planned mission. Where would the terrorists strike next? What plans were unfolding, perhaps at this very hour?<br><br>"I don&#x2019;t know, I don&#x2019;t know," the woman would occasionally manage, in a soft mumble. She repeated the line slowly, as though drugged.<br><br>Abu Haytham pleaded with her. He threatened. He appealed to her conscience, to religion, to Allah. Hours passed&#x2014;crucial hours, he feared.<br><br>"How brainwashed you are!" he shouted at one point. "Why do you protect the people who put you up to this?"<br><br>The woman would never offer a useful syllable, then or in the months to come, after she was convicted and sentenced to die. Yet, already, Abu Haytham knew who was behind the act. All the Mukhabarat&#x2019;s men knew, even before the culprit boasted of his responsibility in an audio recording made in his own voice. The signatures were all there: The coordinated blasts, all within ten minutes; the deployment of human bombers, each skillfully fitted with a device consisting of military-grade RDX explosive and enough loose metal to ensure maximum carnage. Most telling of all was the choice of targets&#x2014;ordinary hotels where, on any given evening, Amman&#x2019;s middle class would pack a rented ballroom in their finest apparel to celebrate a union or mark a milestone. No intelligence operative or general was likely to pass through the lobby of the Radisson at 9:00 p.m. on a weekday night. But scores of Jordanians would be there, clinging to the rituals of normal life in a country bordering a war zone.<br><br>Such hallmarks, like the voice on the audio recording, unmistakably belonged to Zarqawi, a man the Mukhabarat knew exceptionally well. He was, at the time of the bombing, the head of a particularly vicious terrorist network called al-Qaeda in Iraq. But the Jordanians had known him back in the days when he was Ahmad the hoodlum, a high school dropout with a reputation as a heavy drinker and a brawler. They had watched him wander off to Afghanistan in the late 1980s to fight the communists, then return as a battle-hardened religious fanatic. After a first try at terrorism, he had vanished into one of Jordan&#x2019;s darkest prisons. This time he emerged as a battle-hardened religious fanatic who also happened to excel as a leader of men.<br><br>Abu Haytham had been among those who tried to alter Zarqawi&#x2019;s path after prison. He had been the last intelligence officer to meet with him in 1999, before Zarqawi was granted permission to leave the country for good, headed again to Afghanistan and a future that surely&#x2014;so the Jordanians thought&#x2014;offered nothing more than futility and a dusty grave.<br><br>Then, in the most improbable of events, America intervened. Few beyond the intelligence service had heard of Zarqawi when Washington made him a terrorist superstar, declaring to the world in 2003 that this obscure Jordanian was the link between Iraq&#x2019;s dictatorship and the plotters behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The claim was wrong, yet, weeks later, when U.S. troops invaded Iraq, the newly famous and well-funded terrorist gained a battleground and a cause and soon thousands of followers. Over three tumultuous years, he intentionally pushed Iraq to the brink of sectarian war by unleashing wave after wave of savage attacks on Shiite civilians in their mosques, bazaars, and schools. He horrified millions with a new form of highly intimate terrorism: the beheading of individual hostages, captured on video and sent around the world, using the Internet&#x2019;s new power to broadcast directly into people&#x2019;s homes. Along the way, he lashed out violently at his native Jordan and helped transform America&#x2019;s lightning victory in Iraq into the costliest U.S. military campaign since Vietnam.<br><br>Yet his most significant accomplishment was not apparent until years later. Though some would cast his movement as an al-Qaeda offshoot, Zarqawi was no one&#x2019;s acolyte. His brand of jihadism was utterly, brutally original. Osama bin Laden had sought to liberate Muslim nations gradually from corrupting Western influences so they could someday unify as a single Islamic theocracy, or caliphate. Zarqawi, by contrast, insisted that he would create his caliphate immediately&#x2014;right now. He would seek ...</p></p><h2>Living with Air Plants: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Growing and Displaying Tillandsia</h2><p><i>Living with Air Plants</i> is the perfect introduction to the world of Tillandsia and the many ways they can be used to design and upgrade your home or work space.

Ching</strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author Francis D.K. Ching</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br>The idea for a visual dictionary of architecture evolved slowly over a number of years as I taught in the design studio, read books and articles, and confronted terms that were either new to me, were being used in sometimes contradictory ways, or simply tossed out with the assumption that everyone knew what they meant. And so I often asked myself what did these terms really mean? <br><br>Of course, there were already general dictionaries that supplied these meanings if one bothered to look them up, and for more discipline-specific terms, there were architectural, historical, and construction dictionaries available. But few had more than a smattering of illustrations. And since architecture is such a visual art, I believed there was a need for a truly visual dictionary. The few visual dictionaries that were available simply named various things and their constituent parts but neglected to supply definitions and meanings. So there was this void to be filled. <br><br>The initial phase of the project, of course, consisted of gathering essential architectural terms and their definitions from various sources. For many, I had to reference textbooks to more fully understand the meaning of a term and then to compose a concise yet accurate definition. At times, defining one term required including other terms embedded in the definition. This led to a natural nesting of terms into sets. <br><br>As I continued to compile terms and thought about the project, it became clear that I wanted to not only properly define architectural terms but also gather them in a way that related the terms to each other in a logical and hierarchical way, using both illustrations as well as relative positioning on a page to convey these relationships. So then the truly challenging and fun part of the project was to see how I could organize the terms in such a way that their groupings into sections and subsections made sense. <br><br>To do this, I started with fairly obvious divisions, such as design and structures. Once the fundamental term was defined, I then arranged related terms in a hierarchical fashion. For example, design can be defined both as a process and a product, which led to two different sections. In the case of structures, I began with the basic idea of a structure and related concepts that applied to all structures, regardless of material or scale. The second level of terms began with basic types of structural elements, such as arches and beams, and structural systems, such as frames and plate structures, each of which deserved its own section. <br><br>Historical terms created its own set of problems regarding inclusion and proper placement. While some terms may be considered obsolete, they remained, in my view, useful as points of reference or retained a certain charm. <br><br>Once I had identified the major sections of the dictionary and assigned each term to one of the sections, I imported them into Pagemaker and began laying out the terms and definitions on each page according to their relationships to each other. <br><br>I then printed the page out and laid tracing paper over the page and roughed out ideas for illustrations. In many cases, this necessitated moving some of the terms and their definitions around. I then did the final drawings for each page on a single sheet with leader lines and arrows. After these sheets of drawings were scanned, I placed the scans in Pagemaker and adjusted the terms and definitions further to fit. In this second edition, I used Photoshop to eliminate the leader lines and arrows and used the lines and arrows within InDesign. This gave me some leeway in the placement of the images. <br><br>It has been a pleasure to develop this second edition and I hope the spirit and flavor of the first edition endures the inclusion of current technology.<br><p>Presented in Francis D.K. Ching's signature style, this long-awaited Second Edition of A Visual Dictionary of Architecture is a remarkable, one-of-a-kind compendium that combines textual definitions and hundreds of superb line drawings to illuminate a comprehensive body of essential terms in architecture, including important interrelationships between building components. Grouped by themes, such as history, systems, structures, forms, construction, environmental issues, and behavior, all terms have their visual complement and can be readily accessed in a number of different ways.</p> <p>Whether you're an architect, interior designer, construction practitioner, or simply interested in the field of architecture, A Visual Dictionary of Architecture, Second Edition provides an authoritative source of information for tracking down an elusive word&#x2014;and a delight for simple armchair browsing.</p></p><h2>Sophocles : Antigone (Focus Classical Library)</h2><p>This is an English translation of Sophocles&#x2019; tragedy of Antigone and her fate when she decides to bury her dead brother Polyneices.

Their subjects are as varied as your own daily spiritual needs. Each one will deepen your faith, enlighten your understanding, and lift your heart to God. </p><p> Two respected Catholic men of letters collaborated to make this unique collection possible: Robert Anderson, an Aquinas expert and professor of philosophy, and Catholic poet Johann Moser, whose own poems have been acclaimed by Russell Kirk, Thomas Howard, Fr. George Rutler, and others. </p><p> Together, these men have produced a work remarkable for its accuracy, its beauty, and, above all, for its profound spirituality. Now you, too, can pray those prayers that helped make St. Thomas Aquinas one of the Church's most renowned and revered saints. </p><p> Among the prayers: </p><p> -Before Study</p><p> -Adoro Te Devote, Latens Deitas</p><p> -To Acquire the Virtues</p><p> -For Ordering a Life Wisely</p><p> -For the Attainment of Heaven</p><p> -Before and After Communion</p>St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was one of the Church&#39;s greatest theologians ever. This stirring volume demonstrates that he was also a great saint with an unquenchable love for God.</p><h2>The Wind Book for Rifle Shooters: How to Improve Your Accuracy in Mild to Blustery Conditions</h2><p>All other factors being equal, it is your ability to read the wind that will make the most difference in your shooting accuracy.

Between 1870 and 1900, the United States&#x2019; population doubled, accompanied by an unparalleled industrial expansion, and an explosion of wealth unlike any the world had ever seen. America was the foremost nation of the world, and New York City was its beating heart. There, the richest and most influential&#x2014;Thomas Edison, J. P. Morgan, Edith Wharton, the Vanderbilts, Andrew Carnegie, and more&#x2014;became icons, whose comings and goings were breathlessly reported in the papers of Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst. It was a time of abundance, but also bitter rivalries, in work and play. The Old Money titans found themselves besieged by a vanguard of New Money interlopers eager to gain entr�e into their world of formal balls, debutante parties, opera boxes, sailing regattas, and summer gatherings at Newport. Into this morass of money and desire stepped Caroline Astor. </p><p>Mrs. Astor, an Old Money heiress of the first order, became convinced that she was uniquely qualified to uphold the manners and mores of Gilded Age America. Wherever she went, Mrs. Astor made her judgments, dictating proper behavior and demeanor, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s codes of dress, acceptable patterns of speech and movements of the body, and what and when to eat and drink. The ladies and gentlemen of high society took note. &#x201c;What would Mrs. Astor do?&#x201d; became the question every social climber sought to answer. And an invitation to her annual ball was a golden ticket into the ranks of New York&#x2019;s upper crust. This work serves as a guide to manners as well as an insight to Mrs. Astor&#x2019;s personal diary and address book, showing everything from the perfect table setting to the array of outfits the elite wore at the time. Channeling the queen of the Gilded Age herself, Cecelia Tichi paints a portrait of New York&#x2019;s social elite, from the schools to which they sent their children, to their lavish mansions and even their reactions to the political and personal scandals of the day. </p><p>Ceceilia Tichi invites us on a beautifully illustrated tour of the Gilded Age, transporting readers to New York at its most fashionable. A colorful tapestry of fun facts and true tales, What Would Mrs. Astor Do? presents a vivid portrait of this remarkable time of social metamorphosis, starring Caroline Astor, the ultimate gatekeeper.</p></p><p><b>Cecelia Tichi</b> is William R.

Platforms that operate for business purposes usually exist at the level of an industry or ecosystem, bringing together individuals and organizations so they can innovate and interact in ways not otherwise possible. Platforms create economic value far beyond what we see in conventional companies.</p><p><em>The Business of Platforms</em> is an invaluable, in-depth look at platform strategy and digital innovation. Cusumano, Gawer, and Yoffie address how a small number of companies have come to exert extraordinary influence over every dimension of our personal, professional, and political lives. They explain how these new entities differ from the powerful corporations of the past. They also question whether there are limits to the market dominance and expansion of these digital juggernauts. Finally, they discuss the role governments should play in rethinking data privacy laws, antitrust, and other regulations that could reign in abuses from these powerful businesses. </p><p>Their goal is to help managers and entrepreneurs build platform businesses that can stand the test of time and win their share of battles with both digital and conventional competitors. As experts who have studied and worked with these firms for some thirty years, this book is the most authoritative and timely investigation yet of the powerful economic and technological forces that make platform businesses, from Amazon and Apple to Microsoft, Facebook, and Google&#x2014;all dominant players in shaping the global economy, the future of work, and the political world we now face. </p></p><p><p>Michael A.

Its history stretches back almost to the founding of the nation and includes many colorful characters, both well known and obscure, from the hatchet-wielding prohibitionist Carry Nation to George Garvin Brown, who in 1872 created Old Forester, the first bourbon to be sold only by the bottle. Although obscured by myth, the history of bourbon reflects the history of our nation.<br><br>Historian Michael R. Veach reveals the true story of bourbon in <i>Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey</i>. Starting with the Whiskey Rebellion of the 1790s, he traces the history of this unique beverage through the Industrial Revolution, the Civil War, Prohibition, the Great Depression, and up to the present. Veach explores aspects of bourbon that have been ignored by others, including the technology behind its production, the effects of the Pure Food and Drug Act, and how Prohibition contributed to the Great Depression. The myths surrounding bourbon are legion, but Veach separates fact from legend. While the true origin of the spirit may never be known for certain, he proposes a compelling new theory.<br><br>With the explosion of super-premium bourbons and craft distilleries and the establishment of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail, interest in bourbon has never been higher.

Written and illustrated by P. D. Eastman&#x2014;with help from the Cat (Dr. Seuss)&#x2014;this decades-old dictionary pairs words with pictures that carry their meaning, making it simple enough even for nonreaders to understand. A wacky cast of characters reappears throughout the book, making this perhaps the only dictionary in the world that is actually <i>fun </i>to read!</p><p>A decades-old dictionary that you can still use today (and know that children will love it) is an amazing testament to the genius of the Seuss stable. The roughly 12-per-page colored drawings are dated, of course--the humans far more than the animals, funnily enough--but they've aged in a way that adds to their charm rather than detracting from it. (<i>Phonograph</i> may take some explaining; ditto <i>typewriter</i>, which we recently heard described as "like a computer, only with paper instead of a screen.") The 1,350 words are well balanced between the obvious stuff--common nouns and verbs--and more abstract language, from <i>about</i> to <i>yet</i>. Each word is accompanied by a drawing and an illustrative sentence. Along the way, naturally, we meet a wacky menagerie of humans and animals: "Aaron the alligator making more machines," "Aunt Ada standing on her head," etc. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Illus. in full color. &#34;The picture carries the meaning in this dictionary of over a thousand elementary words from &#39;Aaron&#39; the alligator to a nest full of &#39;zyxuzpf&#39; birds. The book gets a large &#39;A&#39; for its commonsense-through-nonsense approach to reading.&#34; &#34;The New York Times.</p><h2>Performance Automotive Engine Math (Sa Design-Pro)</h2><p>All the parts within any engine are designed and engineered using the appropriate mathematics to function efficiently and be durable. When discussing high-performance automotive engines, a specific set of math formulas are used to develop and design powerplants to make more power at higher rpm levels and still survive. The various forms of motorsport and street use all have different requirements, but the math used to design engines to be competitive does not change, regardless of the specific discipline. <p>Multi-time author and well-regarded performance engine builder/designer John Baechtel has assembled the relevant mathematics and packaged it all together in a book designed for automotive enthusiasts. This book walks readers through the complete engine, showcasing the methodology required to define each specific parameter, and how to translate the engineering math to the hard measurements reflected in various engine parts. Designing the engine to work as a system of related components is no small task, but the ease with which Baechtel escorts the reader through the process makes this book perfect for both the budding engine enthusiast and the professional builder. </p><p>Author Baechtel's experience and writing capabilities shine in <i>Performance Automotive Engine Math</i>, and this book will surely be a strong addition to any high-performance library.</p></p><p>High-performance racing engines differ from their street-based counterparts in many ways, but what specific internal design differences separate them? One answer lies in the math used to develop the best-possible performing powerplants for racing use. When engineered for maximum effectiveness and durability at high power levels and extreme RPM, performance engines of all types need to be built as a complete system. The sizes, clearances, and capabilities of these intricate machines are not chosen by chance, but rather through the use of proven formulas. In this book you&#x2019;ll find these formulas and the logic behind them. Everything from figuring out the engine&#x2019;s true displacement and compression ratio to determining the best-possible port size and camshaft dimensions are included. Whether you&#x2019;re a seasoned professional or a curious amateur, Performance Automotive Engine Math is a valuable learning guide and reference tool. Determining the best way to achieve high volumetric efficiency is the goal of all performance enthusiasts, and this book shows you exactly how to accomplish this, by the numbers.John Baechtel is a former editor of <i>Car Craft</i> and <i>Hot Rod </i>magazines and was a founding partner of the Westech Performance Group engine dyno-testing facility. With more than 34 years of high-performance engine and vehicle testing under his belt, he is a veteran author of many books, including <i>Performance Automotive Engine Math</i> and <i>Competition Engine Building</i>.</p><h2>Defining Moments: When Managers Must Choose Between Right and Right</h2><p><b>When Business and Personal Values Collide</b><br><br> Defining moments&#x201d; occur when managers face business decisions that trigger conflicts with their personal values. These moments test a person&#x2019;s commitment to those values and ultimately shape their character. But these are also the decisions that can make or break a career. Is there a thoughtful, yet pragmatic, way to make the right choice?<br><br>Bestselling author Joseph Badaracco shows how to approach these dilemmas using three case examples that, when taken together, represent the escalating responsibilities and personal tests managers face as they advance in their careers. The first story presents a young manager whose choice will affect him only as an individual; the second, a department head whose decision will influence his organization; the third, a corporate executive whose actions will have much larger, societal ramifications. To guide the decision-making process, the book draws on the insights of four philosophers Aristotle, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, and James who offer distinctly practical, rather than theoretical, advice. <i>Defining Moments</i> is the ultimate manager&#x2019;s guide for resolving issues of conflicting responsibility in practical ways.<br></p><p>"So much of making sound decisions comes from asking smart questions. Defining Moments asks all the right questions in a way that will help any manager who wants to reach judgments that are morally sensitive and professionally sensible." --George Stephanopoulos, Visiting Professor at Columbia University, political analyst for ABC, and former adviser to the Clinton Administration <p>Defining Moments outlines a refreshingly realistic approach to ethics in management. Badaracco shows how managers can choose, without sacrificing their values, between multiple acceptable solutions--not the one right answer that most ethicists claim exists. It is a book to be put into practice, not just read and set aside. --Andrall Pearson, Chairman &amp; CEO, Pepsico Food Division </p><p>Critical decisions between shades of right are inescapable in our professional and personal lives and do create defining moments' for each of us. Badracco brings a clarity to the decision process that I did not think possible. --Gail Long, Senior Vice President, Group Executive, Large Corporate, BankBoston </p><p>Finally, here's a book that helps us prioritize our personal and institutional loyalties and responsibilities in decision making, wend our way through real-life moral mazes, and develop our character in the process. A crystal-clear, practical writer, Badaracco provides a new and unorthodox approach to issues of great complexity. He offers pragmatic assistance to real people weighing conflicting duties, ends, and virtues of business life. --William McLennan, University Chaplain, Tufts University</p><b>Joseph L.

It was first presented on stage to the public in 1912. Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador&#39;s garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women&#39;s independence. In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights, including one of Shaw&#39;s influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea first presented in 1871. Shaw also would have been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw&#39;s play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the musical My Fair Lady and the film of that name.</p><p>Bernard Shaw (1856 &#x2013; 1950), was an Irish playwright, critic and polemicist whose influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays. With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p><h2>Kiss Me Like A Stranger: My Search for Love and Art</h2><p>Gene Wilder is one of the great comic actors who defined the 1970&#39;s and 1980&#39;s in movies. From his early work with Woody Allen to the rich group of movies he made with Mel Brooks to his partnership on screen with Richard Pryor, Wilder&#39;s performances are still discussed and celebrated today. Kiss Me Like A Stranger is an intimate glimpse of the man behind the image on the screen. In this book, Wilder talks about everything from his experiences in psychoanalysis to why he got into acting (and later comedy-his first goal was to be a Shakespearean actor) to how a midwestern childhood with a sick mother changed him. He writes about the creative process on stage and on screen, and divulges moments from life on the sets of the some of the most iconic movies of our time. He also opens up about his love affairs and marriages, including his marriage to comedian Gilda Radner. But the core of Kiss Me Like A Stranger is an actor&#39;s search for truth and a thoughtful analysis of why the choices he made-some of them so serendipitous they were practically accidental-changed the course of his life.</p><p><p>"Gene Wilder's frank, charming memoir, KISS ME LIKE A STRANGER, is refreshingly free from the two major sins of show-biz autobiographies: self-aggrandizement and score-settling."&#x2015;<i>Los Angeles</i><i> Times</i></p><p>In this unusually personal book from the beloved star of many beloved and classic film comedies&#x2015;from <i>The Producers</i> to <i>Young Frankenstein</i> , <i>Blazing Saddles</i> to <i>Willy </i>Wonka <i>and the Chocolate Factory</i>&#x2015;Gene Wilder writes about a side of his life the public hasn't seen on the screen. Wilder talks about everything from his experiences in psychoanalysis to why he got into acting to the funny, wonderful movies he made with Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Richard Pryor, and many others. He writes candidly about the role of women in his life, about the overwhelming experience of marrying comedienne Gilda Radner, and about what ultimately had to happen for him to find true love. KISS ME LIKE A STRANGER is one actor's life in his own words. </p><p>"Uproarishly funny and at times very moving. It made me want to go out and see every Gene Wilder movie again."&#x2015;Mel Brooks</p><p>"an intimate, unusual memoir...His book candidly explores his own faults and feelings, as well as those of the people he's loved and lost."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><b>Gene Wilder (1933-2016) </b>began acting when he was thirteen and writing for the screen since the early 1970s. After a small role in Bonnie and Clyde pulled him away from a career onstage, he was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Leo Bloom in The Producers, which led to Blazing Saddles and then to another Academy nomination, this time for writing Young Frankenstein. Wilder has appeared in twenty-five feature films and a number of stage productions. His first book, about his own life, was <i>Kiss Me Like A Stranger,</i> and was followed by the novels <i>My French Whore, The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t , What Is This Thing Called Love?</i> and S<i>omething to Remember You By.</i></p><h2>Love &amp; Misadventure (Volume 1) (Lang Leav)</h2><p><b>Beautifully illustrated and thoughtfully conceived, Love and Misadventure will take you on a rollercoaster ride through an ill-fated love affair&#x2014;from the initial butterflies through the soaring heights to the devastating plunge.&nbsp; And, in the end, the message is one of hope.</b><br><br>The journey from love to heartbreak to finding love again is personal yet universal.

Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

(John Trent, PhD)</p><h2>The Reciprocating Self: Human Development in Theological Perspective (Christian Association for Psychological Studies Books)</h2><p>On the basis of a theologically grounded understanding of the nature of persons and the self, Jack O. Balswick, Pamela Ebstyne King and Kevin S. Reimer present a model of human development that ranges across all of life's stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle adulthood and elder adulthood. They do this by drawing on a biblical model of relationality, where the created goal or purpose of human development is to become a <em>reciprocating self</em>&#x2015;fully and securely related to others and to God. Along the way, they provide a context for understanding individual development issues&#x2015;concerns, tensions, worries or crises encountered by the self in the context of change. Awareness of these issues is most pronounced at developmental transitional points: learning to talk and walk, beginning to eat unassisted, going to school, developing secondary sexual physical features, leaving home, obtaining full-time employment, becoming engaged and then married, having a child for the first time, parenting an adolescent, watching children move away from home, retiring, experiencing decline in physical and mental health, and, finally, facing imminent death. The authors contend throughout that, since God has created human beings for relationship, to be a self in reciprocating relationships is of major importance in negotiating these developmental issues. Critically engaging social science research and theory, <em>The Reciprocating Self</em> offers an integrated approach that provides insight helpful to college and seminary students as well as those serving in the helping professions. Those in Christian ministry will be especially rewarded by the in-depth discussion of the implications for moral and faith development nurtured in the context of the life of the church. In this revised and expanded second edition, Balswick, King and Reimer have added research from developmental neuroscience and neuropsychology, which connects transitional behavior to a changing brain. They have also included a wealth of research on the moral, spiritual and religious dimensions of human development, in which they introduce the notion of reciprocating spirituality. In addition the authors engage with the burgeoning fields of positive and evolutionary psychology.</p><p>Jack O. Balswick (Ph.D., University of Iowa) is senior professor of sociology and family development at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He has twice received an American Senior Fulbright Scholar Fellowship.He has been associate editor of the Journal of Marriage and Family, Family Relations, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion and Review of Religious Research. He has authored or coauthored articles in over seventy professional publications and has presented papers at conferences around the world. He is author or coauthor of seventeen books, including <i>Men at the Crossroads, The Family: A Christian Perspective on the Contemporary Home, The Gift of Gender, Social Problems: A Christian Understanding and Response, Relationship-Empowerment Parenting, Authentic Human Sexuality, The Reciprocating Self: Human Development in Theological Perspective and A Model for Marriage: Covenant, Grace, Empowerment and Intimacy</i>.<br> Kevin S. Reimer (Ph.D., Fuller School of Psychology)&nbsp;is a faculty member in the School of Education; University of California, Irvine. Educated in the United States and Canada, he holds degrees in developmental psychology, biological sciences, theology and literature."<em>The Reciprocating Self</em> by Balswick, King, and Reimer easily gets my vote as the best book integrating human development and theology. I have been teaching human development for nearly twenty years, and it's rare to find a volume on the lifespan that synthesizes multiple theoretical frameworks and a healthy consideration of diversity and social contexts. Moreover, the motif of the reciprocating self serves to illuminate crucial dimensions of moral, spiritual, and relational development. They have grounded this work in sound research while also offering ample practical applications. This second edition offers integrative engagement with the latest developments in psychology and neuroscience and will inform much of my own teaching and research in the years ahead." (Steven J. Sandage, Albert and Jessie Danielsen Professor of Psychology of Religion and Theology, professor of psychological and brain sciences, director, the Danielsen Research Center, senior staff psychologist, Danielsen Institute, Boston University)<br><br>"I was a big fan of <em>The Reciprocating Self</em>. It is a rare book that delivers a scientific vision of human development through the logic of the spirit, working hard to show the reader how the depth of the human developmental experience is spiritual. So you can imagine this fanboy's glee with the release of this updated second edition! If you missed it the first time, you're in for a treat. This book will broaden your vision and deepen your understanding. I think it is a must for every pastor, youth worker, and children's minister. And if you read the first edition&#x2015;say, in a seminary class&#x2015;now is the time to reread it. This updated version promises you and your ministry new insights." (Andrew Root, Luther Seminary, author of Bonhoeffer as Youth Worker)<br><br>"Every human life originates in a relationship with another person, and humans thrive when their lives involve mutually beneficial, positive relationships with family, friends and community members. <em>The Reciprocating Self</em> creatively integrates developmental science and the wisdom of Christian theology to provide innovative and singularly significant insights about the nature and importance of human relationships in creating human lives marked by meaning, love and fulfillment. Professors Balswick, King and Reimer have written a book that exemplifies the powerful contributions that can be made to understanding and enhancing human development through bridging the best of social and behavioral science and theological verities in a manner that both informs and inspires." (Richard M. Lerner, Bergstrom Chair in Applied Developmental Science, Tufts University)<br><br>"In the Confucian Analects, when asked, 'Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?', the Master replies, 'Is not <em>reciprocity</em> such a word?' In <em>The Reciprocating Self</em>, Jack Balswick, Pamela Ebstyne King and Kevin Reimer have given us a magisterial account of reciprocity in human development. The book reflects the best current thinking in theology and developmental science, a rare and powerful combination. This book should be read by anyone interested in the most promising directions in the study of human development." (William Damon, professor and director, Stanford University Center on Adolescence, author of The Path to Purpose)<br><br>"All empirical and theoretical accounts of human development raise a basic normative question: What counts as maturity or developmental advance? Much contemporary social science tries to sidestep the question; this book does not. It is unique in spelling out the implications of a Christian conception of full human development for the process and nature of development at each stage in the lifespan. Even those who don't share these authors' religious convictions can benefit from seeing what it takes to stake out a particular developmental teleology and see it through. And for those who are seeking a specifically Christian perspective on development, this is a must-read!"

The sappy love songs, the enticing ads for romantic getaways and the desire to be cherished by a special someone will never lose their appeal. But for some women, this poses a significant problem. Because of their insatiable desire for love, they will do anything to find it and ultimately land in destructive addictive relationships over and over again causing incredible harm.<br><br>This newly revised and expanded edition of Ready to Heal provides an opportunity for women to break free from painful addictive relationships. Kelly McDaniel provides the reader with the tools they will need to move along the path of living a life where intimacy is possible. Readers have an opportunity to begin to "connect the dots" in their own relationship patterns by following the stories of four brave women. A newly added chapter on "Mother Hunger" explores the role of the mother in infancy and how she ultimately impacts a daughter's ability to have healthy intimate relationships later in life.<br><br>Kelly McDaniel, MA, LPC, NCC, CSAT is a licensed professional counselor and sex addiction therapist in private practice in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>In her private practice as a therapist, she assist adults and couples. Incorporating a background from the Jean Baker Miller Institute of Relational/Cultural therapy, and the latest training in addiction research, she works closely and confidentially with individuals seeking support with relationship difficulty, general life dissatisfaction, family of origin issues, and attachment fear. <br>In addition to individual sessions, she conducts retreats in the Texas Hill Country for couples and for women. The "Ready to Heal" retreats for women focus on healing damaging cultural beliefs that affect sexuality and self-development and can lead to addictive relationships. Issues of childhood upbringing, culture, and biology affect the development of the sexual arousal template. Couples retreats explore these dynamics with partners seeking a more fulfilling, healthy and loving life. Retreats can be customized to address: codependency, sex and love addiction and recovering couples issues. <br>Additionally, she offers sensitive, specialized support to mothers and parents committed to attachment parenting. Since important neurological patterns are set in the first 18 months of life, she sees parents as architects of their child's brain development. They often need education and support with this critical task. <br>Professional affiliations include certification as a sex addiction therapist (CSAT) from the International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals (IITAP), membership in the Society for the Advancement of Sexual Health (SASH), membership in the Texas Association of Marriage and Family Counselors, Licensure as a Professional Counselor in Texas (LPC), National Certified Counselor (NCC), and a Post Induction Trained therapist in the developmental model designed by Pia Mellody. <br>Education includes an MA from Georgetown University in Washington, DC and an MA from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas.<br>"McDaniel offers rich reflections into the myriad of issues facing women sex and love addicts.

Granna Rabbit is sick, and so his family won't celebrate his favorite part of Kwanzaa this year: a big feast called Karamu. </p><p>Li'l Rabbit knows what to do! He'll find Granna Rabbit a special treat for Karamu so she can celebrate anyway.</p><p>He looks under a pile of logs, in the field, and in the pond and along the way meets Groundhog, Momma Field Mouse, and the frogs&#x2014;but he doesn't find anything for Granna Rabbit.</p><p><em>Maybe I'm just too little to help Granna Rabbit celebrate Kwanzaa</em>, Li'l Rabbit thinks. Or maybe he just needs a little help from his family and friends.</p><p>Inspired by Brer Rabbit, a trickster character from the African-American folklore tradition, the story of Li'l Rabbit captures the true meaning of Kwanzaa&#x2014;coming together to help others.</p></p><p><p>Donna L. Washington is a professional storyteller, multiple-award-winning recording artist, and author. She performs all over the country at festivals, schools, and libraries and gives workshops for parents and educators as well.

He lives in Kansas City, Missouri, where he runs Dream Studio, a community art space.</p>K-Gr 1&#x2013;Feeling too small to be of any use, Li'l Rabbit leaves the house to find something special for his sick grandmother during Karamu, a Kwanzaa feast. Each animal he encounters (Momma Oriole, Groundhog, frogs, etc.) has been on the receiving end of Granna Rabbit's generosity in the past and wants to help in some way. Without realizing it, Li'l Rabbit brings together a whole community for the &#x201c;the best Karamu ever.&#x201d; The Seven Principles of Kwanzaa are listed at the end of the book, providing the only direct details about the holiday. The yellow undertones (like the interior of the Rabbit family's earthy, mustard-colored home) add warmth to the cartoon artwork. Sweetly capturing the spirit of the season, the story comes in handy as a lovely supplement to resources that provide straightforward facts about Kwanzaa.<i>Joanna K.

Walker (Lisa Drew Books (Paperback))</h2><p><b>Soon to be a Netflix series starring Octavia Spencer</b><br> <br><i>On Her Own Ground</i> is the first full-scale, definitive biography of Madam C. J. Walker&#x2014;the legendary African American entrepreneur and philanthropist&#x2014;by her great-great-granddaughter, A'Lelia Bundles.<br><br>The daughter of slaves, Madam C. J. Walker was orphaned at seven, married at fourteen and widowed at twenty. She spent the better part of the next two decades laboring as a washerwoman for $1.50 a week. Then&#x2014;with the discovery of a revolutionary hair care formula for black women&#x2014;everything changed. By her death in 1919, Walker managed to overcome astonishing odds: building a storied beauty empire from the ground up, amassing wealth unprecedented among black women and devoting her life to philanthropy and social activism. Along the way, she formed friendships with great early-twentieth-century political figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington.<br> <br> <i>On Her Own Ground</i> is not only the first comprehensive biography of one of recent history's most amazing entrepreneurs and philanthropists, it is about a woman who is truly an African American icon. Drawn from more than two decades of exhaustive research, the book is enriched by the author's exclusive access to personal letters, records and never-before-seen photographs from the family collection. Bundles also showcases Walker's complex relationship with her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, a celebrated hostess of the Harlem Renaissance and renowned friend to both Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. In chapters such as &#x201c;Freedom Baby,&#x201d; &#x201c;Motherless Child,&#x201d; &#x201c;Bold Moves&#x201d; and &#x201c;Black Metropolis,&#x201d; Bundles traces her ancestor's improbable rise to the top of an international hair care empire that would be run by four generations of Walker women until its sale in 1985. Along the way, <i>On Her Own Ground </i> reveals surprising insights, tells fascinating stories and dispels many misconceptions.</p><p>She was the daughter of slaves, married at 14, a widow with a baby daughter at 20. But, by the time that she was 40, Madam C.J. Walker (1867-1919) was making as much money as a white corporate executive, thanks to her popular hair-care products for black women and her brilliance at marketing them. She created a workforce of sales agents that gave African American women job options other than being washerwomen or domestics. As her prominence and wealth increased, she became a generous benefactor of black educational institutions, and such a staunch supporter of the antilynching movement that the State Department labeled her a "race agitator" and denied her a passport in 1919. Yet, she had plenty of time for fun, too; she built a lavish mansion (near John D. Rockefeller's) in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, and her daughter Lelia entertained the Harlem Renaissance elite in a spectacular Manhattan townhouse that was renovated with revenues from the company's New York branch. Author A'Lelia Bundles, a veteran television journalist and Madam Walker's descendant, reminds us that controversy over straightened hair has raged within the black community for a century, and that the businesswoman insisted that her aim never was to "de-kink" her customers' tresses, but instead to "grow" them through proper care, frequent washing, and improved nutrition. Bundles seamlessly weaves together her great-great-grandmother's remarkable personal odyssey with the broader outlines of African American struggle in the early 20th century, to create a colorful biography that's also a fascinating social history. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>A'Lelia Bundles, an award-winning network television news producer and former ABC News Washington deputy bureau chief, is director of talent development for ABC News. She is the author of numerous essays, articles, and encyclopedia entries about her great-great-grandmother, Madam C.J. Walker, and a young-adult biography, <i>Madam C.J. Walker: Entrepreneur,</i> which won an American Book Award. She lives in Alexandria, Virginia.

Their father, Andy, reached over and squeezed her hand. Ella tried to guess what they were going to say. Was it going to be a new puppy? Or maybe cool matching bikes? <br> <br>&#x201c;Ta-da! We&#x2019;re moving,&#x201d; Mr. Briar announced.<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean to a new house?&#x201d; Ella asked, confused.<br> <br>Mrs. Briar shook her head. &#x201c;No, not to a new house. I just accepted a new job. I&#x2019;m going to be the travel writer for the Brookeston Times.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So why do we have to move? The Brookeston Times is in Brookeston,&#x201d; Ella pointed out. The Times was their town&#x2019;s newspaper&#x2014;everyone read it.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the exciting part,&#x201d; Mr. Briar said. &#x201c;Starting next week we&#x2019;ll be traveling to different foreign cities so your mom can write about them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Foreign, like, another country?&#x201d; Ethan asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Mr. Briar said happily. &#x201c;Like Spain and England and Peru and India and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait! Did you say next week?&#x201d; Ella interrupted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep. We&#x2019;re leaving next Sunday,&#x201d; Mrs. Briar said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next Sunday?!&#x201d; Ethan exclaimed. &#x201c;What about school? And soccer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And our friends? And Grandpa Harry? Will we be able to visit them?&#x201d; Ella asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; Mrs. Briar paused. &#x201c;Not right away. But we can stay in touch with everyone. And, of course, we&#x2019;ll come back to Brookeston&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Someday. We&#x2019;re just not yet sure when,&#x201d; Mr. Briar finished.<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>Ethan put his fork down.

Places like the Great Wall of China, the Eiffel Tower in France&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do they have soccer in China and France?&#x201d; Ethan cut in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course! And as for school, we&#x2019;ve already spoken to Principal McDermott. I&#x2019;ll be homeschooling you both,&#x201d; Mr. Briar went on.<br> <br><br> <br>Mr. Briar was a history professor at Brookeston University. He was supersmart. He knew stuff like who invented the boogie board (Tom Morey) and the name of the first king of England (Egbert).<br> <br><br> <br>Still, Ella could not imagine their dad being their teacher. He didn&#x2019;t sing silly &#x201c;good morning&#x201d; songs like their real second-grade teacher, Mrs. Applebaum.

Written by a world-renowned industry expert, the reference discusses how to forecast returns under different parameters. Expected returns of major asset classes, investment strategies, and the effects of underlying risk factors such as growth, inflation, liquidity, and different risk perspectives, are also explained. Judging expected returns requires balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current market conditions. <i>Expected Returns</i> provides extensive empirical evidence, surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights.</p><p>For any investor, understanding the expected rewards that markets offer is central to long-term investment success. The traditional paradigm for assessing expected returns has focussed on historical performance and asset class management. However, Antti Ilmanen contends that this approach to investment decision-making is too narrow in its asset class focus and in the inputs used for assessing expected returns. He challenges investors to broaden their perspectives in two ways: <ul> <li>Excess returns should be harvested from diverse sources. Strategy styles and risk factors, as well as asset classes, are sources of return, thus warranting three-dimensional analysis of investments.</li> <li>Any investment's return prospects should be judged in a way that incorporates all knowledge, including historical experience, financial and behavioral theories, and current market conditions, without being overly dependent on any one of these.</li> </ul> <p>Beginning with comprehensive introduction and overview, <i>Expected Returns</i> goes on to analyze the historical record, give a roadmap of terminology, explore rational and behavioral theories, and look at alternative interpretations for return predictability. A series of case studies provide detailed analysis of assets (equity, bond and credit risk premia, as well as alternative asset classes), dynamic strategy styles (value, carry, momentum, volatility) and underlying risk factors (growth, inflation, liquidity and tail risks), before moving back to broader themes, including time-varying expected returns, and seasonal, cyclical and secular return patterns.</p> <p>Concluding with a series of investment lessons, <i>Expected Returns</i> is the complete guide for the long-term investor, providing wide-ranging empirical evidence, and a platform for forecasting the expected returns of an investment portfolio for asset allocation and portfolio balancing purposes</p> <p>&nbsp;"Job one for any investor is to estimate asset class returns. For the first time, Antti Ilmanen has assembled into one volume all of the tools necessary for this task: for the working money manager, a unique treasure trove of analytical techniques and empirical evidence; for the academic, a comprehensive guide to the relevant academic literature; and for the consultant, a blinding light with which to illuminate performance. Expected Returns is destined to occupy the front shelves of investment professionals around the world."<br> <b>William J. Bernstein, author of The Intelligent Asset Allocator, The Birth of Plenty, and A Splendid Exchange, and co-principal of Efficient Frontier Advisors</b></p> <p>"Antti's synthesis of experience and theory has given us a book which fills a major gap in the literature on investing. Amazing, but true, this is the first book dedicated to the critical and challenging task of estimating how much we should expect to earn on our investments. This illuminating book, teaming with valuable insights that have never before been gathered under one roof, cannot fail to make the reader a more successful and discerning investor."<br> <b>Victor Haghani, Associate Lecturer, London School of Economics, and former founding partner of LTCM</b></p> <p>"Ilmanen has written a thorough and detailed analysis of one of the central issues in investing."<br> <b>Ken French, Heidt Professor of Finance, Dartmouth College</b></p> <p>"Investors' decisions should be evidence based. Antti Ilmanen assembles a global body of evidence, and interprets it with insight. Read this book and you will improve your understanding of the future."<br> <b>Elroy Dimson, Emeritus Professor of Finance, London Business School</b></p> <p>"If I could choose only one book on active management, I would choose Expected Returns. This book is extremely thorough and well researched, yet direct and to the point."<br> <b>Roger G. Ibbotson, Professor in the Practice of Finance, Yale School of Management, and Chairman and CIO of Zebra Capital Management</b> &nbsp;</p><i>Expected Returns</i> is a one-stop reference that gives investors a comprehensive toolkit for harvesting market rewards from a wide range of investments. Written by an experienced portfolio manager, scholar, strategist, investment advisor and hedge fund trader, this book challenges investors to broaden their minds from a too-narrow asset class perspective and excessive focus on historical performance. Coverage includes major asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives), investment strategies (value, carry, momentum, volatility) and the effects of underlying risk factors (growth, inflation, illiquidity, tail risks). Judging expected returns requires balancing historical returns with both theoretical considerations and current market conditions. <i>Expected Returns</i> summarizes the state of knowledge on all of these topics, providing extensive empirical evidence, surveys of risk-based and behavioral theories, and practical insights. <p>"This is the best book on active management ever written - and it achieves that status without mentioning a single stock or bond by name. Anyone who performs the rigorous analysis Ilmanen describes - admittedly a neat trick, since the world's most sophisticated investors struggle to do it successfully - will beat the market."<br> &#x2014;<b>Laurence B. Siegel, Former Director of Research, The Ford Foundation</b></p> <p>"Antti Ilmanen shows the way forward for the investment management profession in this remarkable book. In a comprehensive and impressive way, he combines financial theory, historical performance data and forward-looking indicators, into a consistent framework for assessing expected returns and risk. His approach is both scientific and practical, based on decades of studies and his own trading experience. With a touch of personal wisdom and humility, Ilmanen's book is a fascinating and educational journey into the future of investment management."<br> &#x2014;<b>Knut N. Kjaer, Founding CEO of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund/NBIM and former president of RiskMetrics Group</b></p> <p>"Ilmanen's wonderful book manages to be exquisitely readable while covering just about every aspect of the investment process.

These are stories from those years on the street. That place I named so long ago, the other reality that exists just outside most people&#x2019;s everyday lives. It is a place that seems to exist parallel to the normal workaday existence: yet it is only a car accident or cardiac away for any of us. It manifested itself in brushfires, house fires, shootings, stabbings, hangings, accidents with injuries, cardiacs, codes, drownings, and a thousand other emergencies. The street was more than a physical place. It was a place filled with excitement, fear, tragedy, horror, sadness, despair, joy, and laughter. It was a place where routine decisions could have terrible consequences: I am going to the grocery store. Or, I will get the wiring fixed next month. Where people died or were maimed. Often, it was terrible place. Or maybe it was reality. It was where all safeguards ended and our job began. There were thousands of cases, but these are the ones etched in my memory. The ones that will never go away." Roger Huder</p><p></p><h2>Teaching Arguments: Rhetorical Comprehension, Critique, and Response</h2><p>No matter where&nbsp; students&#x2019; lives lead after graduation, one of the most essential tools we can teach them is how to comprehend, analyze, and respond to arguments. Students need to know how writers&#x2019; and speakers&#x2019; choices are shaped by elements of the rhetorical situation, including audience, occasion, and purpose. In <i>Teaching Arguments</i>, Jennifer Fletcher provides teachers with engaging classroom activities, writing prompts, graphic organizers, and student samples to help students at all levels read, write, listen, speak, and think rhetorically.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jennifer believes that, with appropriate scaffolding and encouragement, <i>all </i>students can learn a rhetorical approach to argument and gain access to rigorous academic content. <i>Teaching Arguments</i> opens the door and helps them pay closer attention to the acts of meaning around them, to notice persuasive strategies that might not be apparent at first glance. When we analyze and develop arguments, we have to consider more than just the printed words on the page. We have to evaluate multiple perspectives; the tension between belief and doubt; the interplay of reason, character, and emotion; the dynamics of occasion, audience, and purpose; and how our own identities shape what we read and write. Rhetoric teaches us how to do these things. <i>Teaching Arguments </i>will help students learn to move beyond a superficial response to texts so they can analyze and craft sophisticated, persuasive arguments&#x2014;a major cornerstone for being not just college-and career-ready but ready for the challenges of the world.</p><p>Jennifer FletcherI first met Jennifer Fletcher when she joined our ERWC Task Force as a high school representative. At the time she was Chair of English at Buena Park High School, but she was working on a Ph.D. at UC Riverside (and raising two kids!). Soon she surprised us by taking an English Education position at CSU Monterey Bay. Jennifer has an amazing resume: high school teaching, chairing a department, scholarship, and publications. She is quite agile in moving from theory to practice. And she lives and breathes ERWC.<br> So it was no surprise to me when she published this wonderful and timely book,<i>Teaching Arguments: Rhetorical Comprehension, Critique, and Response</i>.<br> The book synthesizes concepts from classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, Common Core State Standards, and Jennifer&#x2019;s teaching experience and wisdom. It manages to be both academic and personal, with practical teaching strategies on every page. As Jennifer herself says in the introduction:<br> This book is about opening doors to deeper learning for all our students through a rhetorical approach to arguments&#x2014;an approach based on situational awareness and responsiveness instead of rules and formulas. Throughout the chapters, you&#x2019;ll find detailed examples of activities, such as the rhetorical pr�cis, descriptive outlining, and the doubting and believing game, that show students how to move beyond a superficial response to texts (xiv).<br> A bit later she offers a justification for teaching rhetorically:<br> Rhetoric targets the conventions and processes of high academic literacy, including the sophisticated responsiveness to context that characterizes college and workplace writing. Writing rhetorically means writing with attention to argument, purpose, audience, authority, and style demanded by academic texts (xv).<br> The first chapter is about &#x201c;open-minded&#x201d; inquiry. It begins with activities for closely attending to the features of a text, even a visual text such as a painting. Then Peter Elbow&#x2019;s &#x201c;believing game&#x201d; is introduced (the &#x201c;doubting game&#x201d; will appear in the next chapter) along with checklist questions for facilitating the activity. This is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of an op-ed by David Brooks, followed by a section on &#x201c;Discovering the Question at Issue&#x201d; which is built around the Ciceronian concept of stasis. Stasis theory is presented with lots of examples and sample questions, making it clear how it might be used with students. Though the theories deployed span centuries, everything is tied together by the focus on the classroom and the students and by the author&#x2019;s personal experience.<br> Subsequent chapters discuss critical approaches to text, modern application of the ancient Greek concept of&nbsp;<i>Kairos</i>&nbsp;(timeliness and appropriateness), audience, purpose, and the three appeals&#x2013;<i>ethos, pathos</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>logos</i>. The chapter on the appeals is especially useful because it goes deep into each appeal rather than engaging in the checklist sort of approach that many teachers fall into. Every rhetorical concept is described, contextualized, demonstrated, and explained, often with charts, handouts and other activities that can be used directly in class, with more available in the appendix.<br> The final chapter is called &#x201c;Aristotle&#x2019;s Guide to Becoming a &#x2018;Good&#x2019; Student,&#x201d; but it is really Jennifer&#x2019;s guide. It focuses on habit, identity, confidence, self-perception, performance, insiders versus outsiders, modeling, mentoring, teachable moments, imitation, and flow.

Bruise the delicate petals and they seem to bleed. The blood-red liquid is an oil released from tiny, dark-colored glands scattered along the petal margins. In ancient times, a plant that &#x201c;bled&#x201d; was assumed to possess great powers. <br> &nbsp;<br> During the rise of Christianity, the herb came to be associated with John the Baptist (wort is the Old English word for plant). It was said to bloom on the saint&#x2019;s birthday, June 24, and to bleed on August 29, the anniversary of his beheading. The earliest use of the name may date to the sixth century, when the Irish missionary St. Columba carried the herb with him into northern Scotland. The genus name, Hypericum, is from the Greek, meaning &#x201c;over a picture or icon&#x201d;&#x2014;a reference to the custom of draping the herb over religious images to strengthen their powers in banishing demons. For many centuries, St. John&#x2019;s wort was a symbol of protection against evil, but also a prized medicinal herb, with the power to heal the body and ease the troubled mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ancient Greek and Roman physicians used St. John&#x2019;s wort to dress battle wounds, as well as treat burns, bruises, and inflammations. Hundreds of years later, as battles raged in the Holy Land, the crusaders treated their wounds with St. John&#x2019;s wort in much the same way. Throughout the Middle Ages, heart conditions, jaundice, dysentery, bleeding, urinary troubles, and nervous depression were all treated with the herb. Also popular at this time, and for centuries afterward, was hypericum oil, a preparation made from the flowers and rubbed into the skin to heal bruises and wounds. By the late 17th century, St. John&#x2019;s wort had been incorporated into American herbal medicine, prescribed externally for wounds and sores and internally for nervous anxiety and depression.<br> &nbsp;<br> After falling into disuse early in the last century, St. John&#x2019;s wort has seen a remarkable revival in the past few decades. It is currently the most widely used herb in modern herbal medicine for treating mild to moderate depression. St. John&#x2019;s wort is also used to relieve anxiety, ner- vous exhaustion, seasonal affective disorder, premenstrual syndrome, and to help heal minor wounds and skin irritations.</p><h2>Letters to Marc About Jesus: Living a Spiritual Life in a Material World</h2><p><p> <i>Letters to Marc About Jesus</i> is a beautiful collection of Henri Nouwen's very intimate and very enlightening writings to Marc, his nineteen-year-old nephew, who struggles to find his true path in a world of confusion and apathy.

Powerful and profound, <i>Letters to Marc About Jesus</i> is Nouwen at his best-teacher, guide, and mentor-and will provide the direction and inspiration necessary for any believer to change his or her life. </p></p><p>Henri J.M.

The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-winkle was first published in 1905, and is as charming today as it was then. It tells the tale of a hidden home high in the hills. It is discovered one day by a little girl called Lucie, who is in search of her missing pocket handkerchiefs. She knocks on the tiny door, and meets Mrs Tiggy-winkle who does all the washing and ironing for the neighbouring animals. Lucie spends a lovely day helping her, and it&#39;s only right at the end of the day that she realises Mrs Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog! Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world&#39;s best-loved children&#39;s authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy. Today Beatrix Potter&#39;s original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books. The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-winkle is number six in Beatrix Potter&#39;s series of 23 little books. Look out for the rest! 1 The Tale of Peter Rabbit 2 The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin 3 The Tailor of Gloucester 4 The Tale of Benjamin Bunny 5 The Tale of Two Bad Mice 6 The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle 7 The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher 8 The Tale of Tom Kitten 9 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck 10 The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies 11 The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse 12 The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes 13 The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse 14 The Tale of Mr. Tod 15 The Tale of Pigling Bland 16 The Tale of Samuel Whiskers 17 The Tale of The Pie and the Patty-Pan 18 The Tale of Ginger and Pickles 19 The Tale of Little Pig Robinson 20 The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit 21 The Story of Miss Moppet 22 Appley Dapply&#39;s Nursery Rhymes 23 Cecily Parsley&#39;s Nursery Rhymes</p><p>Beatrix Potter loved the countryside and spent much of her childhood drawing and studying animals. The Tale of Peter Rabbit� published in 1902, was her first book, expanded from an illustrated letter she had sent to a young friend. Beatrix Potter went on to publish more than 20 tales and collections of rhymes.Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl - only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs! <p> One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying - oh, she did cry so! "I've lost my pocket-handkin!

Any speculative theory seems to get instant attention as the debate rages about His real identity and the claims made in His name. Did Jesus really exist? Is there real historical evidence that demonstrates that He lived and actually said and did the things the Gospels record? Is there any validity to the speculative claims that the Jesus story was a myth, borrowed from a variety of pagan cultures of the ancient world?</p><p>In this follow-up to the book <em>God&#x2019;s Not Dead</em> (that inspired the movie), <em>Man, Myth, Messiah</em> looks at the evidence for the historical Jesus and exposes the notions of skeptics that Jesus was a contrived figure of ancient mythology. It also looks at the reliability of the Gospel records as well as the evidence for the resurrection that validates His identity as the promised Messiah. <em>Man, Myth, Messiah</em> will be released concurrent to the <em>God&#x2019;s Not Dead </em>movie sequel, which will cover the same theme.</p></p><p><p>Rice Broocks is the cofounder of the Every Nation family of churches, with more than one thousand churches in more than 73 nations.

The Shape of Design is a map of the road where we dance rather than a blueprint of it. It strives to investigate the opportunities of exploring the terrain, and it values stepping back from the everyday concerns of designing. It attempts to impose a meaningful distance in order to patterns in the work and assess the practice as a whole. One can observe, from this distance, two very fundamental things about design that are easy to miss in the midst of all of this movement. First, design is imagining a future and working toward it with intelligence and cleverness. We use design to close the gap between the situation we have and the one we desire. Second, design is a practice built upon making things for other people. We are all on the road together. These two things dictate our relationship to the world and our bond to one another. They form the foundations of the design practice, so our work should revolve around these truths.</p><p></p><h2>The Witcher Volume 4: Of Flesh and Flame</h2><p><b>Based on the hit games by CD Projekt Red!<br><br>Geralt is summoned by an old acquaintance to help solve a mystery involving his daughter.

Like many kids, he was first inspired to become a manga artist in elementary school when he read Dragon Ball. After spending time in art college, he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his story Karakuri. After considering various genres for his next project, Kishimoto decided on a story steeped in traditional Japanese culture. His first version of Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in the world. The series would also spawn multiple anime series, movies, novels, video games and more. Having concluded the series in late 2014, Masashi Kishimoto has kept himself busy this year with the side story Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring and writing the story for the latest Naruto movie, Boruto: Naruto the Movie, both of which will focus on the title character&#39;s son, Boruto.</p><h2>The Voyager&#39;s Handbook: The Essential Guide to Blue Water Cruising</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Belongs in the bookshelf of every cruising vessel.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Blue Water Sailing</i> </p><p>&#x201c;If you are serious about that extended voyage, read <i>The Voyager&#x2019;s Handbook</i>.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Sailing</i> </p><p>&#x201c;Every now and then a new voice emerges in the world of sailing literature that stands out, a voice that is both clear and of lasting quality.

It has transcended time and space to become one of the world&#39;s all time great success stories. Orphaned at age 4, he never attended school a day in his life as a student; yet the reading and research that he undertook to help his own children, unlocked secrets of the mind and human potential that had remained hidden for thousands of years. Jos� Silva&#39;s 22 years of dogged determination to dig out these secrets has literally changed the world. He actually found the secret of success. He first started working with his own children in 1944, then in the 1950s and 1960s helped his neighbors learn how to actually use the untapped power of their minds to get whatever they wanted. While he never asked them to pay him, he was rewarded greatly with more knowledge on this subject than anyone else on the planet. From 1966 to 1998 his Silva Mind Control Method helped millions of people worldwide, and since 1998 his Silva UltraMind ESP System is leading people into what he called &#34;the beginning of the second phase of human evolution on the planet.&#34; This man with no formal schooling wrote the book on mind development - in fact, he&#39;s had more than a dozen books published by major publishers, in two dozen languages. Prior to his passing in 1999 he developed a new course - actually more than a course, he calls it a system: The Silva UltraMind ESP System. In addition to helping people develop and use their own God-given intuition, the UltraMind ESP System includes a new scientifically-based technique to communicate with higher intelligence regularly and reliably to obtain help and guidance in carrying out your mission in life. While Jos� Silva may have moved on to new assignments, his work is still going strong, in live seminars, books, and in convenient home study courses. There are many courses that are &#34;based on&#34; his work, but the only courses still being taught that he authored himself, based on his 22 years of scientific research, are the Silva UltraMind ESP System, and his Holistic Faith Healing System.

Some of them immediately forgot the faces they saw and the names they heard spoken in formal introductions. Some of them actually forgot the whole day; and when it became so important, twenty-one years later, they had to pretend to remember; to stare at blurred photographs and murmur, &#x201c;Ah, yes, of course,&#x201d; in a knowing way.</p><p>This early meeting is a coincidence, but not a very startling one. They were mostly young and able; they were destined to have power, to take decisions, and to make changes, each in their different ways, in their different countries; and those people often meet in their youth at places like Oxford University. Furthermore, when all<i> this</i> happened, those who were not involved initially were sucked into it just <i>because</i> they had met the others at Oxford.</p><p>However, it did not seem like an historic meeting at the time. It was just another sherry party in a place where there were too many sherry parties (and, undergraduates would add, not enough sherry). It was an uneventful occasion.

First, Cortone had heard that Nat Dickstein had been taken prisoner. Towards the end of the war, stories began to circulate about what was happening to Jews in the Nazi camps. Then, at the end, the grim truth came out.</p><p>On the other side of the door, a ghost scraped a chair on the floor and padded across the room.</p><p>Cortone felt suddenly nervous. What if Dickstein were disabled, deformed? Suppose he had become unhinged? Cortone had never known how to deal with cripples or crazy men. He and Dickstein had become very close, just for a few days back in 1943; but what was Dickstein like now?</p><p>The door opened, and Cortone said, &#x201c;Hi, Nat.&#x201d;</p><p>Dickstein stared at him; then his face split in a wide grin and he came out with one of his ridiculous Cockney phrases: &#x201c;Gawd, stone the crows!&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone grinned back, relieved. They shook hands, and slapped each other on the back, and let rip some soldierly language just for the hell of it; then they went inside.</p><p>Dickstein&#x2019;s home was one high-ceilinged room of an old house in a run-down part of the city. There was a single bed, neatly made up in army fashion; a heavy old wardrobe of dark wood with a matching dresser; and a table piled with books in front of a small window. Cortone thought the room looked bare. If he had to live here he would put some personal stuff all around to make the place look like his own: photographs of his family, souvenirs of Niagara and Miami Beach, his high school football trophy.</p><p>Dickstein said, &#x201c;What I want to know is, how did you find me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you, it wasn&#x2019;t easy.&#x201d; Cortone took off his uniform jacket and laid it on the narrow bed. &#x201c;It took me most of yesterday.&#x201d; He eyed the only easy chair in the room. Both arms tilted sideways at odd angles, a spring poked through the faded chrysanthemums of the fabric, and one missing foot had been replaced with a copy of Plato&#x2019;s<i> Theaetetus.</i> &#x201c;Can human beings sit on that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not above the rank of sergeant. But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t human anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>They both laughed: it was an old joke. Dickstein brought a bentwood chair from the table and straddled it. He looked his friend up and down for a moment and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting fat.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone patted the slight swell of his stomach. &#x201c;We live well in Frankfurt&#x2014;you really missed out, getting demobilized.&#x201d; He leaned forward and lowered his voice, as if what he was saying was somewhat confidential. &#x201c;I have made a <i>fortune.</i> Jewelry, china, antiques&#x2014;all bought for cigarettes and soap. The Germans are starving. And&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;the girls will do anything for a Tootsie Roll.&#x201d; He sat back, waiting for a laugh, but Dickstein just stared at him straight-faced. Disconcerted, Cortone changed the subject. &#x201c;One thing you ain&#x2019;t, is fat.&#x201d;</p><p>At first he had been so relieved to see Dickstein still in one piece and grinning the same grin that he had not looked at him closely. Now he realized that his friend was worse than thin: he looked wasted. Nat Dickstein had always been short and slight, but now he seemed all bones. The dead-white skin, and the large brown eyes behind the plastic-rimmed spectacles, accentuated the effect. Between the top of his sock and the cuff of his trouser-leg a few inches of pale shin showed like matchwood. Four years ago Dickstein had been brown, stringy, as hard as the leather soles of his British Army boots. When Cortone talked about his English buddy, as he often did, he would say, &#x201c;The toughest, meanest bastard fighting soldier that ever saved my goddamn life, and I ain&#x2019;t shittin&#x2019; you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fat? No,&#x201d; Dickstein said. &#x201c;This country is still on iron rations, mate. But we manage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve known worse.&#x201d;</p><p>Dickstein smiled. &#x201c;And eaten it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You got took prisoner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At La Molina.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How the hell did they tie you down?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy.&#x201d; Dickstein shrugged. &#x201c;A bullet broke my leg and I passed out. When I came round I was in a German truck.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone looked at Dickstein&#x2019;s legs. &#x201c;It mended okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was lucky. There was a medic in my truck on the POW train&#x2014;he set the bone.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone nodded. &#x201c;And then the camp...&#x201d; He thought maybe he should not ask, but he wanted to know.</p><p>Dickstein looked away. &#x201c;It was all right until they found out I&#x2019;m Jewish. Do you want a cup of tea? I can&#x2019;t afford whiskey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Cortone wished he had kept his mouth shut. &#x201c;Anyway, I don&#x2019;t drink whiskey in the morning anymore. Life doesn&#x2019;t seem as short as it used to.&#x201d;</p><p>Dickstein&#x2019;s eyes swiveled back toward Cortone. &#x201c;They decided to find out how many times they could break a leg in the same place and mend it again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus.&#x201d; Cortone&#x2019;s voice was a whisper.</p><p>&#x201c;That was the best part,&#x201d; Dickstein said in a flat monotone. He looked away again.</p><p>Cortone said, &#x201c;Bastards.&#x201d; He could not think of anything else to say. There was a strange expression on Dickstein&#x2019;s face; something Cortone had not seen before, something&#x2014;he realized after a moment&#x2014;that was very like fear. It was odd. After all, it was over now, wasn&#x2019;t it? &#x201c;Well, hell, at least we won, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; He punched Dickstein&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>Dickstein grinned. &#x201c;We did. Now, what are you doing in England? And how did you find me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I managed to get a stopover in London on my way back to Buffalo. I went to the War Office&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Cortone hesitated. He had gone to the War Office to find out how and when Dickstein died. &#x201c;They gave me an address in Stepney,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;When I got there, there was only one house left standing in the whole street. In this house, underneath an inch of dust, I find this old man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tommy Coster.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Well, after I drink nineteen cups of weak tea and listen to the story of his life, he sends me to another house around the corner, where I find your mother, drink more weak tea and hear the story of her life. By the time I get your address it&#x2019;s too late to catch the last train to Oxford, so I wait until the morning, and here I am. I only have a few hours&#x2014;my ship sails tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got your discharge?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In three weeks, two days and ninety-four minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do, back home?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Run the family business. I&#x2019;ve discovered, in the last couple of years, that I am a terrific businessman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What business is your family in? You never told me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Trucking,&#x201d; Cortone said shortly. &#x201c;And you? What is this with Oxford University, for Christ&#x2019;s sake? What are you studying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hebrew Literature.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could write Hebrew before I went to school, didn&#x2019;t I ever tell you? My grandfather was a real scholar. He lived in one smelly room over a pie shop in the Mile End Road. I went there every Saturday and Sunday, since before I can remember. I never complained&#x2014;I love it. Anyway, what else would I study?&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, atomic physics maybe, or business management. Why study at all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To become happy, clever and rich.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone shook his head. &#x201c;Weird as ever. Lots of girls here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very few. Besides, I&#x2019;m busy.&#x201d;</p><p>He thought Dickstein was blushing. &#x201c;Liar. You&#x2019;re in love, you fool. I can tell. Who is she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, to be honest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Dickstein was embarrassed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s out of reach. A professor&#x2019;s wife. Exotic, intelligent, the most beautiful woman I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone made a dubious face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not promising, Nat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Dickstein stood up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see what I mean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I get to meet her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Professor Ashford is giving a sherry party. I&#x2019;m invited. I was just leaving when you got here.&#x201d; Dickstein put on his jacket.</p><p>&#x201c;A sherry party in Oxford,&#x201d; Cortone said. &#x201c;Wait till they hear about this in Buffalo!&#x201d;</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>It was a cold, bright morning. Pale sunshine washed the cream-colored stone of the city&#x2019;s old buildings. They walked in comfortable silence, hands in pockets, shoulders hunched against the biting November wind which whistled through the streets. Cortone kept muttering, &#x201c;Dreaming spires. Fuck.&#x201d;</p><p>There were very few people about, but after they had walked a mile or so Dickstein pointed across the road to a tall man with a college scarf wound around his neck. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the Russian,&#x201d; he said. He called, &#x201c;Hey, Rostov!&#x201d;</p><p>The Russian looked up, waved, and crossed to their side of the street. He had an army haircut, and was too long and thin for his mass-produced suit. Cortone was beginning to think everyone was thin in this country.</p><p>Dickstein said, &#x201c;Rostov&#x2019;s at Balliol, same college as me. David Rostov, meet Alan Cortone. Al and I were together in Italy for a while. Going to Ashford&#x2019;s house, Rostov?&#x201d;</p><p>The Russian nodded solemnly. &#x201c;Anything for a free drink.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone said, &#x201c;You interested in Hebrew Literature too?&#x201d;</p><p>Rostov said, &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m here to study bourgeois economics.&#x201d;</p><p>Dickstein laughed loudly. Cortone did not see the joke. Dickstein explained, &#x201c;Rostov is from Smolensk. He&#x2019;s a member of the CPSU&#x2014;the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.&#x201d; Cortone still did not see the joke.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought nobody was allowed to leave Russia,&#x201d; Cortone said.</p><p>Rostov went into a long and involved explanation which had to do with his father&#x2019;s having been a diplomat in Japan when the war broke out. He had an earnest expression which occasionally gave way to a sly smile. Although his English was imperfect, he managed to give Cortone the impression that he was condescending. Cortone turned off, and began to think about how you could love a man as if he was your own brother, fighting side by side with him, and then he could go off and study Hebrew Literature and you would realize you never really knew him at all.</p><p>Eventually Rostov said to Dickstein, &#x201c;Have you decided yet, about going to Palestine?&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone said, &#x201c;Palestine? What for?&#x201d;</p><p>Dickstein looked troubled. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t decided.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should go,&#x201d; said Rostov. &#x201c;The Jewish National Home will help to break up the last remnants of the British Empire in the Middle East.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that the Party line?&#x201d; Dickstein asked with a faint smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Rostov said seriously. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a socialist&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of sorts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;and it is important that the new State should be socialist.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone was incredulous. &#x201c;The Arabs are murdering you people out there. Jeez, Nat, you only just escaped from the Germans!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t decided,&#x201d; Dickstein repeated. He shook his head irritably. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do.&#x201d; It seemed he did not want to talk about it.</p><p>They were walking briskly. Cortone&#x2019;s face was freezing, but he was perspiring beneath his winter uniform. The other two began to discuss a scandal: a man called Mosley&#x2014;the name meant nothing to Cortone&#x2014;had been persuaded to enter Oxford in a van and make a speech at the Martyr&#x2019;s Memorial. Mosley was a Fascist, he gathered a moment later. Rostov was arguing that the incident proved how social democracy was closer to Fascism than Communism. Dickstein claimed the undergraduates who organized the event were just trying to be &#x201c;shocking.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone listened and watched the two men. They were an odd couple: tall Rostov, his scarf like a striped bandage, taking long strides, his too-short trousers flapping like flags; and diminutive Dickstein with big eyes and round spectacles, wearing a demob suit, looking like a skeleton in a hurry. Cortone was no academic, but he figured he could smell out bullshit in any language, and he knew that neither of them was saying what he believed: Rostov was parroting some kind of official dogma, and Dickstein&#x2019;s brittle unconcern masked a different, deeper attitude. When Dickstein laughed about Mosley, he sounded like a child laughing after a nightmare. They both argued cleverly but without emotion: it was like a fencing match with blunted swords.</p><p>Eventually Dickstein seemed to realize that Cortone was being left out of the discussion and began to talk about their host. &#x201c;Stephen Ashford is a bit eccentric, but a remarkable man,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He spent most of his life in the Middle East. Made a small fortune and lost it, by all accounts. He used to do crazy things, like crossing the Arabian Desert on a camel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That might be the least crazy way to cross it,&#x201d; Cortone said.</p><p>Rostov said, &#x201c;Ashford has a Lebanese wife.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone looked at Dickstein. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s younger than he is,&#x201d; Dickstein said hastily. &#x201c;He brought her back to England just before the war and became Professor of Semitic Literature here. If he gives you Marsala instead of sherry it means you&#x2019;ve overstayed your welcome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;People know the difference?&#x201d; Cortone said.</p><p>&#x201c;This is his house.&#x201d;</p><p>Cortone was half expecting a Moorish villa, but the Ashford home was imitation Tudor, painted white with green woodwork. The garden in front was a jungle of shrubs. The three young men walked up a brick pathway to the house. The front door was open. They entered a small, square hall. Somewhere in the house several people laughed: the party had started. A pair of double doors opened and the most beautiful woman in the world came out.</p><p>Cortone was transfixed. He stood and stared as she came across the carpet to welcome them. He heard Dickstein say, &#x201c;This is my friend Alan Cortone,&#x201d; and suddenly he was touching her long brown hand, warm and dry and fine-boned, and he never wanted to let go.</p><p>She turned away and led them into the drawing room. Dickstein touched Cortone&#x2019;s arm and grinned: he had known what was going on in his friend&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>Cortone recovered his composure sufficiently to say, &#x201c;Wow.&#x201d;</p><p>Small glasses of sherry were lined up with military precision on a little table. She handed one to Cortone, smiled, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Eila Ashford, by the way.&#x201d;</p><p>Co...</p></p><h2>The Shadow Club</h2><p>The Shadow Club starts simply enough: the kids who are tired of being second-best get together and, for the first time, talk about how they feel. But soon the members decide to play practical jokes on the first-place winners they envy, and things begin to spin dangerously out of control.<br><br>"This is a provocative novel . . . The plot is ingeniously simple and the course of events compelling. Brisk enough to snag a popular audience, but forceful in impact, it will leave readers thinking." (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)</p><p>Neal Shusterman is an award-winning author and screenwriter.&nbsp; He lives in Southern California with his four children.Grade 8 Up A group of competitive high-school students, all second best in their areas of talent, form a secret club in order to pull anonymous practical jokes on their rivals. The pranks, which at first are humiliating but harmless, escalate to the point that they result in vandalism and injury and nearly cause a student's death. Shusterman's focus is on how the actions of these teens create a power that feeds on a previously hidden cruel or evil side of their personalities. This is strong material, and sections of the book have a punch that matches the subject. The dialogue of the teens, their concerns, and especially their feelings, are on target. Unfortunately, most of the book lacks suspense. The club members believe that an unpopular student who has eavesdropped on them is responsible for some of the more vicious pranks, but this is such an obvious red herring that the drama of the situation is lost. This book is neither as complex nor as well written as Robert Cormier's novels, but as its premise and tone hold interest, The Shadow Club may appeal to Cormier's fans and those readers who are not yet ready for his books.

You'll have to ask God about that... I intend to write these character's stories, one year at a time, for as long as I'm able to write. I'm passionate about bringing history to life through historical fiction. Since I'm amazingly healthy, that could be for a very long time! I don't like stories to end any more than you do. This one won't end for a very long time! </p> <p>Review: Best historical series I have ever read! Having visited many of the civil war sites, it is so easy to picture the events that take place in Ginny Dye's series. I have learned so much of how the people who fought and died and suffered during this tragic event in our history! What a waste of American lives....The love interests in the story were told in a wonderful way. Finished Dark Chaos and just bought the 5th in the series!! </p> <p>Review: I absolutely love this series by Ginny Dye! I read a lot of books about the Civil War, and this series makes you really think about so many things, both large and small, that took place during those years. I have learned so much about things I never stopped to really think about and have a much better appreciation for what they endured for so long. It has really changed my thinking on many issues, and for the better! </p> <p>Review: As usual I enjoyed every word. It is interesting, entertaining and suspenseful. I dread the end of the series because I enjoyed it so much. You picked a very important time in history. It helps us learn more about the battles, conditions and thoughts of people at that time. It is a lot more interesting to learn from Historical fiction than a boring text book. Great Job! </p></p><p><p>Ginny would love to get to know every single person who reads her books.

As time collapses into memory, he travels deep into his past, where he is reunited with his father and relives the wonder and pain of his impoverished New England youth. At once heartbreaking and life affirming, <i>Tinkers</i> is an elegiac meditation on love, loss, and the fierce beauty of nature.</p><p>The story behind this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling debut novel&#x2015;the first independently published Pulitzer Prize winner since <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> received the award nearly thirty years before&#x2015;is as extraordinary as the elegant prose within it.

Following numerous rejections from large publishers, Harding was about to shelve the manuscript when Bellevue Literary Press offered a contract. After being accepted by BLP, but before it was even published, the novel developed a following among independent booksellers from coast to coast. Readers and critics soon fell in love, and it went on to receive the Pulitzer Prize, prompting the <i>New York Times</i> to declare the novel&#x2019;s remarkable success &#x201c;the most dramatic literary Cinderella story of recent memory.&#x201d; </p><p>That story is still being written as readers across the country continue to discover this modern classic, which has now sold over half a million copies, proving once again that great literature has a thriving and passionate audience.</p><p><b>Paul Harding</b> is the author of two novels about multiple generations of a New England family: <i>Enon</i> and the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tinkers</i>.

The ELT book includes 45 thematic chapters, over 1400 questions, 500 vocabulary words, 250 proverbs and American idioms, and 500 quotations. Designed for both adult education and intensive English language students, the conversations deepen critical thinking skills and speaking skills essential to success in community college and university programs. Compelling Conversations has been used in classrooms in over 50 countries, recommended by English Teaching Professional magazine, and enjoyed by thousands of English students.</p><p>Colors fade, temples crumble, empires fall, but wise words endure." <br>- Edward Thorndike (1874-1949), American psychologist<br><br>The art of conversation, once considered the sign of a civilized individual, seems less common today. Yet I treasure the moments of sharing experiences, collecting news, and exchanging ideas. I make a point of knowing my neighbors, allowing casual greetings to become long conversations, and making time to explore in depth the feelings and perceptions of friends, students, and relatives. These natural conversations provide information, encouragement, and pleasure.<br><br>Many people say that they are too busy to have long talks. Other people prefer to watch YouTube, play computer games, chat via email rather than talk to relatives, co-workers, and friends. Many Americans, it seems, have forgotten how to hold good, deep conversations - or even a friendly chat on the phone. I suspect this lack of real communication lessens their daily joy. <br><br>English language learners, of course, face many more barriers to have a satisfying conversation in English. First, English remains a confusing, difficult, and strange language. It's very easy to feel uncomfortable when speaking a new language - whether a second or fourth.&nbsp; English students in my advanced speaking skills courses often ask questions like: <br><ul><li>How do start a conversation?</li><li>What questions do I ask? </li><li>How can I keep a real conversation going? </li><li>How do I share agreement - or disagreement - in a polite way? </li><li>How can I share my experiences in clear manner with appropriate vocabulary? </li><li>How I can have better, more engaging conversations? </li></ul><i>Compelling Conversations: Questions and Quotations on Timeless Topics </i>addresses these issues for both native and non-native speakers. The focus remains on learning by doing and making "good mistakes". (Good mistakes, by the way, are natural mistakes that help us learn so we can make different and better "good mistakes" next time.) <br><br>Each of the 45 thematic chapters focuses on a promising conversation topic. Every chapter includes 30 or more questions (both direct and indirect), 10 or more targeted academic vocabulary words, a few proverbs to paraphrase, and 10 or more quotations to discuss from a variety of perspectives. Although designed for advanced English language learners, many intermediate ESL and EFL students will plenty of material to use can can benefit from exposure to authentic questions, common phrases, and new vocabulary words. <br><br>As I tell my university English students, "your English may not be perfect yet, but daily practice does lead to significant progress." <i>Compelling Conversations</i> gives students, teachers, and tutors the tools and phrases to talk more and listen better to friends, classmates, and strangers in English.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy creating many compelling conversations - in and out - of the English classrooms! <br><br>Eric H.

As children we loved our bodies and rarely thought about them. As we grew older, though, we soon fell out of love, and with good reason. Billions of dollars are spent to cure the body of its many ills and miseries. Billions more are thrown down the drain for cosmetics, whose purpose is to fool us into thinking we look better than we do. To be blunt, the human body is unsatisfactory and has been for a long time. It can't be trusted, since sickness often strikes without warning. It deteriorates over time and eventually dies. Let's attack this problem seriously. Instead of making do with the physical form you were given at birth, why not look for a breakthrough, a completely new way of approaching the body?<br><br>Breakthroughs occur when you start thinking about a problem in a fresh new way. The biggest breakthroughs occur when you start thinking in an unbounded way. Take your eyes away from what you see in the mirror. If you came from Mars and have never seen how the body ages and declines over time, you might believe it would work in just the opposite way. From a biological point of view, there's no reason why the body should be flawed. So start there. Having erased every outworn assumption from your mind, you are now free to entertain some breakthrough ideas that totally change the situation:<br><br>Your body is boundless. It is channeling the energy, creativity, and intelligence of the entire universe.<br><br>At this moment, the universe is listening through your ears, seeing through your eyes, experiencing through your brain.<br><br>Your purpose for being here is to allow the universe to evolve.<br><br>None of this is outlandish. The human body is already the universe's most advanced laboratory experiment. You and I are at the cutting edge of life. Our best chance for survival is to embrace that fact. Rapid evolution, faster than that for any other life-form on the planet, gave us our present state of ever-increasing health, longer lifespan, exploding creativity, and a vision of possibilities that science advances faster and faster. Our physical evolution ceased around 200,000 years ago. You don't possess liver, lungs, heart, or kidneys different from those of a cave dweller. Indeed, you share 60 percent of your genes with a banana, 90 percent with a mouse, and more than 99 percent with a chimpanzee. In other words, everything else that makes us human has depended on an evolution that is far more nonphysical than physical. We invented ourselves, and as we did so, we brought our bodies along for the ride.<br><br>How you invented yourself<br><br>You have been inventing your body from the day you were born, and the reason you don't see it that way is that the process comes so naturally. It's easy to take for granted, and that's the problem. The flaws you see in your body today aren't inherent. They aren't bad news delivered by your genes or mistakes made by Nature. Your choices each played a part in the body you created, either consciously or unconsciously.<br><br>Here's a list of physical changes that you have made and continue to make. It's a very basic list, all medically valid, and yet hardly any part of your body is excluded.<br><br>Every skill you learn creates a new neural network in your brain.<br><br>Every new thought creates a unique pattern of brain activity.<br><br>Any change in mood is conveyed via "messenger molecules" to every part of the body, altering the basic chemical activity of each cell.<br><br>Every time you exercise, you alter your skeleton and muscles.<br><br>Every bite of food you eat alters your daily metabolism, electrolyte balance, and proportion of fat to muscle.<br><br>Your sexual activity and the decision to reproduce affects your hormonal balance.<br><br>The stress level to which you subject yourself raises and lowers your immune system.<br><br>Every hour of total inactivity creates muscle atrophy.<br><br>Your genes tune in to your thoughts and emotions, and in mysterious ways they switch on and off according to your desires.<br><br>Your immune system gets stronger or weaker in response to being in a loving or unloving relationship.<br><br>Crises of grief, loss, and loneliness increase the risk of disease and shortened lifespan.<br><br>Using your mind keeps your brain young; not using your brain leads to its decline.<br><br>Using these tools, you invented your body and can reinvent it anytime you want. The obvious question is, Why haven't we reinvented our bodies already? Certainly the problems have been staring us in the face long enough. The answer is that solving small pieces of the puzzle has been much easier than seeing the whole. Medicine is practiced in specialties. If you fall in love, an endocrinologist can report on the decline of stress hormones in your endocrine system. A psychiatrist can report on your improved mood, which a neurologist can confirm through a brain scan. A dietician may be worried that you're losing your appetite; on the other hand, what you do eat is digested better. And so it goes. No one can provide you with a complete picture.<br><br>To make matters more complex, because the body is so fluid and so superbly multitasking, it's difficult to imagine there's any one step to take that could lead to transformation. Right now you may be in love, pregnant, running down a country lane, eating a new diet, losing sleep or gaining it, doing better at your job or worse. Your body is nothing less than a universe in motion.<br><br>Reinventing the body means changing the whole universe.<br><br>Trying to tinker with your body misses the forest for the trees. One person fixates on her weight, another trains for a marathon, and yet another is adopting a vegan diet while her friend is dealing with menopause. Thomas Edison didn't tinker with building a better kerosene lamp; he abandoned the use of fire--the only human-generated source of light since prehistoric times--and broke through to a new source. That was a quantum leap in creativity. If you are the creator of your body, what is the quantum leap awaiting you?<br><br>Going back to the source<br><br>If we use Edison as our model, the last great reinvention of the body followed certain principles:<br><br>The body is an object.<br><br>It fits together like a complicated machine.<br><br>The machine breaks down over time.<br><br>The body's machinery is constantly attacked by germs and other microbes, which are also tiny machines on a molecular scale.<br><br>But these are all outmoded ideas. If any of these assumptions were true, then the following couldn't happen: a new syndrome recently appeared called electro-sensitivity, in which people complain that simply being near electricity causes discomfort and pain. Electro-sensitivity is taken seriously enough that at least one country, Sweden, will pay to have a person's house shielded from the electromagnetic field if they are diagnosed as electro-sensitive.<br><br>The widespread fear that cell phones harm the body has reached no definitive conclusion, but it seemed far easier to test whether there is such a thing as electro-sensitivity. In one experiment, subjects were put inside an electromagnetic field (we are surrounded by these every day in the form of microwaves, radio and television signals, cell-phone transmissions, and power lines), and as the field was turned on or off, they were asked to say what they felt. It turned out that nobody did better than random. People who described themselves as electro-sensitive did no better than anyone else, which means no better than random guessing.<br><br>However, this didn't settle the matter. In a follow-up experiment, people were given cell phones and asked if they could feel pain or discomfort when they placed the phones against their heads. The electro-sensitive people described a range of discomfort, including sharp pain and headache, and by looking at their brains with MRIs, it could be seen that they were telling the truth. The pain centers in their brains were activated. The catch is that the cell phones were dummies and were emitting no electrical signals of any kind. Therefore, the mere expectation that they would be in pain was enough to create pain in certain people, and the next time they used a real cell phone, they would suffer from the syndrome.<br><br>Before you dismiss this as a psychosomatic effect, pause and consider. If someone says he is electro-sensitive, and his brain acts as if he is electro-sensitive, the condition is real--at least for him. Psychosomatic conditions are real for those who experience them. But it's just as true to say that they created the conditions. In fact, there is a much larger phenomenon at work here--the ebb and flow of new diseases that may be new creations. Another example is anorexia and related eating disorders like bulimia. A generation ago, such disorders were rare, and now they appear to be endemic, especially among teenage girls. Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, had its heyday but now seems to be fading. Cutting, a form of self-mutilation in which the patient, usually a young woman, secretly slices superficial wounds into her skin with a razor or knife, appears to be on the rise after a period of almost total obscurity.<br><br>When such new disorders appear, the first reaction is always that the victims created a sickness that is essentially imaginary or psychotic. Yet when the disorder spreads, and doctors find that patients cannot turn off the switch that turned the illness on, there can be only one conclusion. Self-created symptoms are real.<br><br>Machines can't create new disorders. But then the whole machine model was imperfect from the start. If you drive a car long enough, its moving parts are ground down by friction. But if you use a muscle, it gets stronger. Non-use, which helps keeps a machine in pristine condition, leads to atrophy with our bodies. Creaky, arthritic joints seem like a perfect example of moving parts that have worn out, but arthritis is actually caused by a host of complex disorders, not just simple friction.<br><br>During your lifetime this outworn model of the body hasn't changed but has only been tinkered with. So what is your body, then, if it's not a machine? Your whole body is a holistic, dynamic process in support of being alive. You are in charge of that process, and yet no one has given you the knowledge of how you should approach your job. Perhaps that is because the enterprise is immense: it covers everything, and it never stops.<br><br>The process of life<br><br>At this moment your body is a river that never stays the same, a continuous stream merging hundreds of thousands of chemical changes at the cellular level. Those changes aren't random; they constantly serve the purpose of moving life forward and preserving what's best from the past. Your DNA is like an encyclopedia that stores the entire history of evolution. Before you were born, your DNA thumbed through the pages to make sure every piece of knowledge was in place. In the womb, an embryo starts out as a single cell, the simplest form of life. It progresses to a loosely assembled blob of cells. Then, step by step, the embryo goes through the evolutionary stages of fish, amphibian, and lower mammal. Primitive gills appear and then disappear to make way for lungs.<br><br>By the time a baby emerges into the world, evolution has overshot the mark. Your brain was too complex as a newborn, with millions of unnecessary neuronal connections built into it, like a telephone system with too many wires. You spent your first few years paring down those millions of surplus connections, discarding the ones you didn't need, keeping those that functioned to make you exactly who you were. But at that point physical evolution reached unknown territory. Choices had to be made that were not automatically built into your genes.<br><br>A baby stands at the frontier of the unknown, and its genes have no more old pages left in the encyclopedia. You had to write the next page yourself. As you did so, starting the process of forming a totally unique life, your body kept pace: your genes adapted to how you think, feel, and act. You probably don't know that identical twins, born with exactly the same DNA, look very different genetically when they grow up: certain genes have been switched on, others switched off. By age seventy, images taken of the chromosomes of two twins don't look remotely the same. As life diverges, genes adapt.<br><br>Take a simple skill like walking. With each clumsy step, a toddler begins to change its brain. The nerve centers responsible for balance, known as the vestibular system, start to wake up and show activity; this is one area of the brain that can't develop in the uterus. Once a toddler has mastered walking, the vestibular system has completed this phase of its function.<br><br>But later, after you grow up, you might want to learn to drive a car, ride a motorcycle, or walk a balance beam. The brain, even though it may be mature, doesn't stop there. Quite the opposite: when you want to learn a new skill, your brain adapts according to your desire. A basic function like balance can be fine-tuned and trained far beyond the base level. This is the miracle of the mind-body connection. You are not hard-wired. Your brain is fluid and flexible, able to create new connections up into very old age. Far from decaying, the brain is an engine of evolution. Where physical evolution appeared to stop, it actually left an open door.<br><br>I want to take you through that door, because much more lies beyond it than you ever imagined. You were designed to unlock hidden possibilities that will remain hidden without you. An image comes to mind of probably the greatest feat of balance ever exhibited by a human being. You may have seen photos of it. On August 7, 1974, a French acrobat named Philippe Petit breached security at the World Trade Center. He climbed onto the roof and, with the help of confederates, strung a 450-pound cable between the two towers. Petit balanced himself with a twenty-six-foot pole as he walked out onto the cable, which stretched 140 feet. Both towers were swaying; the wind was high, the drop below his feet was 104 stories, or a quarter of a mile. Petit was a professional high-wire artist (as he called himself), and he had taken a basic ability of the body, balance, to a new stage.<br><br>What would terrify a normal person became normal for one person. In essence, Petit was at the cutting edge of evolution. He made eight crossings on the wire, which was only three-quarters of an inch in diameter. At one point Petit sat on the wire and even lay down on it. He realized that this was more than a physical feat. Because of the unwavering concentration that was required, Petit developed a mystical regard for what he was doing. His attention had to focus without allowing fear or distraction to enter for even a second.</p><h2>Everyone Can Learn to Ride a Bicycle</h2><p>&#x201c;[Raschka's] marvelous sequences, fluid style, and emotional intelligence capture all of the momentum and exhilaration of this glorious accomplishment,&#x201d; raves <i>School Library Journal</i> in a starred review.<br><br>Learning to ride a bike is one of the most important milestones of childhood, and no one captures the emotional ups and downs of the experience better than Chris Raschka, who won the 2012 Caldecott Medal for <i>A Ball for Daisy</i>. In this simple yet emotionally rich "guide," a father takes his daughter through all the steps in the process&#x2014;from choosing the perfect bicycle to that triumphant first successful ride. Using very few words and lots of expressive pictures, here is a picture book that not only shows kids how to learn to ride, but captures what it <i>feels</i> like to fall . . . get up . . . fall again . . . and finally "by luck, grace, and determination" ride a bicycle!</p><p>CHRIS RASCHKA, the 2012 Caldecott Medalist, is an avid bike rider and wrote a 2010&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>op-ed piece, "Braking Away," about the importance of obeying the rules of the road while on a bicycle. He has written and/or illustrated over 30 books for children, including the 2012 Caldecott Medal winner&nbsp;<i>A Ball for Daisy</i>, which was also a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Best Illustrated Book and described by<i>The Horn Book</i>&nbsp;in a starred review as "noteworthy for both its artistry and its child appeal." His other books include the 2006 Caldecott Medal winner,&nbsp;<i>The Hello, Goodbye Window</i>&nbsp;by Norton Juster; the Caldecott Honor Book&nbsp;<i>Yo? Yes!</i>, and the ALA-ALSC Notable Children's Book&nbsp;<i>Good Sports</i>.*Starred Review* From the reassuring title onward, this vibrant picture book describes learning to ride a bicycle&#x2014;a monumental challenge for many children. A father guides his daughter through the process, which begins with choosing the perfect bike, watching others ride, and realizing that all those expert riders once learned this skill as a beginner, too. The girl begins to ride with the training wheels set low, then set high, and then removed. She takes some spills, gets back on, and tries again. When she is frustrated, her father encourages her to try again and again and again&#x2014;and eventually, she can ride a bicycle. So much is heartening about the book, from the father&#x2019;s consistently kind, matter-of-fact tone to the fact that the process begins with simple steps and leads up to more challenging ones. Rendered in Raschka&#x2019;s signature style of fluid, kinetic brushstrokes, the ink-and-watercolor illustrations beautifully capture the action and emotion in each scene. (Safety-minded adults will also be happy to note that the girl is wearing an enormous helmet throughout the book.) Deceptively simple and perfectly paced for read-alouds, this latest from the two-time Caldecott medalist captures a child&#x2019;s everyday experience with gentle, joyful sensitivity.

Take an in-depth look at the famous fossilized coral&#x2015;including a summary of the fascinating natural history, which began 400 million years ago. Learn all about it, and then head out and search for your own. </p><p>Get expert advice from author Dan R. Lynch on how to identify and collect Petoskey stones. With tips on where to look and what to look for, along with information about Petoskey lookalikes and other fossils you might find, your rock-hounding trips will be better than ever! Suggestions on what to do with your finds and how much they&#x2019;re worth add to the knowledge you&#x2019;ll gain from <i>Petoskey Stone</i>. </p><p>From Lake Michigan beaches and Petoskey State Park to gravel pits and riverbeds, grab this book and begin your rock-hunting adventure!</p></p><p><p><b>Dan R. Lynch</b> grew up in his parents&#x2019; rock shop&#x2015;Agate City, in Two Harbors, Minnesota&#x2015;on the shores of Lake Superior, where he learned the nuances of rock, mineral, and fossil identification firsthand. He has always enjoyed sharing his knowledge, and after earning his degree in graphic design with emphasis on photography from the University of Minnesota Duluth, it seemed a natural choice to combine all of his interests by writing rock and mineral field guides. His father, Bob Lynch, a respected veteran of the Lake Superior agate-collecting community, helped him get his start in this endeavor, and now Dan enjoys helping amateurs &#x201c;decode&#x201d; the complexities of geology and mineralogy. Many of his books focus on specific favorites, such as Lake Superior agates or Petoskey stone, and he takes pride that they all feature his true-to-life photographs and easy-to-read text. He currently lives in Madison, Wisconsin, with his wife, Julie, where he works as an author, artist, and classical numismatist.</p><p><b>How Do I Find Petoskey Stones?</b> </p><p>Part of the reason Petoskey stone is so popular is because it&#x2019;s accessible for almost everyone to find. Finding Petoskey stone does not require any special skills or equipment, simply the desire to venture to natural spaces and turn over every pebble at your feet. </p><p>Because it&#x2019;s a variety of limestone, Petoskey stone can be tricky to spot among the multitude of other limestone and shale pebbles prevalent in the region, especially when the stones are dry. As weathering dulls the details of Petoskey stone, dry specimens are disguised as a chalky brown rock. For this reason, if you suspect a stone is a Petoskey stone, get it wet; water will help bring out the contrast in the fossil patterns, if present. </p><p><b>Collecting Rules and Regulations</b> </p><p>Before you start collecting Petoskey stones (or any other natural material), you need to be aware of the collecting rules and regulations where you are. First of all, collecting in national parks is always prohibited, and many state parks also forbid any collecting. One notable exception is Petoskey State Park, just outside Petoskey, where collecting is allowed. In other state parks, be sure to check the rules and regulations. Of course, you also cannot collect on private property if you don&#x2019;t have permission from the landowner. </p><p>And if you&#x2019;re collecting Petoskey stones on public land, the state of Michigan imposes strict limits on how much you can collect each year. An individual can only collect 25 pounds a year from public land. This means that you could collect many small specimens or just a few large ones, but once you&#x2019;ve reached your limit, please respect these laws and leave your next finds behind. </p><p>If you happen to come across a large specimen that exceeds 25 pounds, you unfortunately need to leave it where you found it. In exceptional cases, when a very large piece in excess of 100 pounds or more is discovered, you&#x2019;re encouraged to report it to local officials. Those who have tried to take home such large discoveries are typically met with confiscation and fines.</p></p><h2>The Golden Rule: Deluxe Edition</h2><p><b>Bestselling author John Green provides a foreword to this deluxe edition of the beloved classic</b><br> &nbsp;<br> With a gorgeous new package and a foreword from bestselling author John Green, the deluxe edition of <i>The Golden Rule</i> spreads the message of kindness to a new generation.

The Materia Medica provides a wealth of information and practical insight into more than 530 of the most commonly used herbs in the Chinese pharmacopoeia. Drawing from a wide range of sources, both classical and modern, it provides unparalleled perspective and detail that goes far beyond what is available elsewhere to the Western practitioner. Among its many features: Herbs are grouped in chapters by function, with expanded summaries and tables for contrast and comparison. Each herb is identified by its pharmaceutical, pinyin, botanical, and family names, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English common names. Key characteristics are provided at the beginning of each entry, along with dosage, properties, channels entered, and relevant cautions and contraindications. This provides a quick overview of essential information. Actions and indications are integrated with important combinations that illustrate the range of an herb s functions, with references to appropriate formulas. This presents a more three-dimensional picture of how each herb is actually used. Expanded commentary offers in-depth analysis and places each herb in its clinical context through rich historical references. The mechanisms of action underlying important combinations, and comparisons with similar herbs, provide a broader context for understanding how the herb can be used with optimal effect. A section devoted to nomenclature and preparation describes the most important methods of processing and preparing each herb, and the advantages of each method. It also provides information about other commonly-used names and historical background. Safety is an important focus of this edition, with an emphasis on proper herb identification. Issues concerning standardized products, desirable qualities, variants, and adulterants are explained for each herb. There is also extensive information on toxicity, as well as chemical constituents. The utility of this book is enhanced by its wide range of appendices, among which are color photographs comparing the standard and adulterant forms of over 20 common herbs; tables of herbs that are indicated for specific pathologies of the five yin organs, and the effects of taste combinations; and extensive cross references of the herbs by taxonomy, pinyin, pharmaceutical name, and other East Asian languages. There are also comprehensive indices of both herbs and formulas, as well as a general index.</p><p>Dan Bensky is a graduate of the Macau Institute of Chinese Medicine (Oriental Medicine Diploma, 1975), University of Michigan (B.A. in Chinese Language and Literature, 1978), Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (Doctor of Osteopathy, 1982), and the University of Washington (M.A. in Classical Chinese, 1996).

Every day I wonder why I&#x2019;m a Jew. But that&#x2019;s part of being Jewish. In the Torah, we&#x2019;re called Yisrael&#x2015;the ones who wrestle with God.

But it wasn&#x2019;t until he began to write about real world enemies in the guise of aliens and monsters that people lent their ears.

The illustrations seem to step right out of a coloring book with simple shapes, objects, and bright, crayon-box colors.

He was also a memoirist who wrote with honesty and humor about the remarkable experiences that shaped him (<i>Uncle Tungsten</i>, <i>On the Move</i>, <i>Gratitude</i>). In the pieces that comprise <i>The River of Consciousness</i> (many first published in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, among other places), Dr. Sacks takes on evolution, botany, chemistry, medicine, neuroscience, and the arts, and calls upon his great scientific and creative heroes--above all, Darwin, Freud, and William James. For Sacks, these thinkers were constant companions from an early age. The questions they explored--the meaning of evolution, the roots of creativity, and the nature of consciousness--lie at the heart of science and of this book. <i>The River of Consciousness </i>demonstrates Sacks's unparalleled ability to make unexpected connections, his sheer joy in knowledge, and his unceasing, timeless endeavor to understand what makes us human.</p><p>Oliver Sacks was a physician, writer, and professor of neurology. Born in London in 1933, he moved to New York City in 1965, where he launched his medical career and began writing case studies of his patients. Called the "poet laureate of medicine" by <i>The New York Times</i>, Sacks is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>, <i>Musicophilia</i>, <i>Awakenings</i> (which inspired an Oscar-nominated film and a play by Harold Pinter), <i>On the Move</i>, and <i>Gratitude</i>.

And, of course, Darwin in the Gal�pagos, observing how the finches were different on each island, starting to experience the seismic shift in understanding how living things evolve that, a quarter of a century later, would result in the publication of On the Origin of Species. The story climaxes here, with the publication of the Origin in November 1859, and has a sort of elegiac postscript: a vision of the older and ailing Darwin, in the twenty-�odd years remaining to him, pottering around his gardens at Down House with no particular plan or purpose, perhaps throwing off a book or two, but with his major work long completed.<br><br>Nothing could be further from the truth. Darwin remained intensely sensitive both to criticisms and to evidence supporting his theory of natural selection, and this led him to bring out no fewer than five editions of the Origin. He might indeed have retreated (or returned) to his garden and his greenhouses after 1859 (there were extensive grounds around Down House, and five greenhouses), but for him these became engines of war, from which he would lob great missiles of evidence at the skeptics outside&#x2014;�descriptions of extraordinary structures and behaviors in plants very difficult to ascribe to special creation or design&#x2014;�a mass of evidence for evolution and natural selection even more overwhelming than that presented in the Origin.<br><br>Strangely, even Darwin scholars pay relatively little attention to this botanical work, even though it encompassed six books and seventy-�odd papers. Thus Duane Isely, in his 1994 book, One Hundred and One Botanists, writes that while<br><br>more has been written about Darwin than any other biologist who ever lived . . . [he] is rarely presented as a botanist. . . . The fact that he wrote several books about his research on plants is mentioned in much Darwinia, but it is casual, somewhat in the light of &#x201c;Well, the great man needs to play now and then.&#x201d;<br><br>Darwin had always had a special, tender feeling for plants and a special admiration, too. (&#x201c;It has always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale of organised beings,&#x201d; he wrote in his autobiography.) He grew up in a botanical family&#x2014;�his grandfather Erasmus Darwin had written a long, two-�volume poem called The Botanic Garden, and Charles himself grew up in a house whose extensive gardens were filled not only with flowers but with a variety of apple trees crossbred for increased vigor. As a university student at Cambridge, the only lectures Darwin consistently attended were those of the botanist J. S. Henslow, and it was Henslow, recognizing the extraordinary qualities of his student, who recommended him for a position on the Beagle.<br><br>It was to Henslow that Darwin wrote very detailed letters full of observations about the fauna and flora and geology of the places he visited. (These letters, when printed and circulated, were to make Darwin famous in scientific circles even before the Beagle returned to England.) And it was for Henslow that Darwin, in the Gal�pagos, made a careful collection of all the plants in flower and noted how different islands in the archipelago could often have different species of the same genus. This was to become a crucial piece of evidence for him as he thought about the role of geographical divergence in the origin of new species.<br><br>Indeed, as David Kohn pointed out in a splendid 2008 essay, Darwin&#x2019;s Gal�pagos plant specimens, numbering well over two hundred, constituted &#x201c;the single most influential natural history collection of live organisms in the entire history of science. . . . They also would turn out to be Darwin&#x2019;s best documented example of the evolution of species on the islands.&#x201d;<br><br>(The birds Darwin collected, by contrast, were not always correctly identified or labeled with their island of origin, and it was only on his return to England that these, supplemented by the specimens collected by his shipmates, were sorted out by the ornithologist John Gould.)<br><br>Darwin became close friends with two botanists, Joseph Dalton Hooker at Kew Gardens and Asa Gray at Harvard. Hooker had become his confidant in the 1840s&#x2014;�the only man to whom he showed the first draft of his work on evolution&#x2014;�and Asa Gray was to join the inner circle in the 1850s. Darwin would write to them both with increasing enthusiasm about &#x201c;our theory.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet though Darwin was happy to call himself a geologist (he wrote three geological books based on his observations during the voyage of the Beagle and conceived a strikingly original theory on the origin of coral atolls, which was confirmed experimentally only in the second half of the twentieth century), he always insisted that he was not a botanist. One reason was that botany had (despite a precocious start in the early eighteenth century with Stephen Hales&#x2019;s Vegetable Staticks, a book full of fascinating experiments on plant physiology) remained almost entirely a descriptive and taxonomic discipline: plants were identified, classified, and named but not investigated. Darwin, by contrast, was preeminently an investigator, concerned with the &#x201c;how&#x201d; and &#x201c;why&#x201d; of plant structure and behavior, not just the &#x201c;what.&#x201d;<br><br>Botany was not a mere avocation or hobby for Darwin, as it was for so many in the Victorian age; the study of plants was always infused for him with theoretical purpose, and the theoretical purpose had to do with evolution and natural selection. It was, as his son Francis wrote, &#x201c;as though he were charged with theorising power ready to flow into any channel on the slightest disturbance, so that no fact, however small, could avoid releasing a stream of theory.&#x201d; And the flow went both ways; Darwin himself often said that &#x201c;no one could be a good observer unless he was an active theoriser.&#x201d;<br><br>In the eighteenth century, the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus had shown that flowers had sexual organs (pistils and stamens), and indeed had based his classifications on these. But it was almost universally believed that flowers were self-�fertilized&#x2014;�why else would each flower contain both male and female organs? Linnaeus himself made merry with the idea, portraying a flower with nine stamens and one pistil as a bedchamber in which a maiden was surrounded by nine lovers. A similar conceit appeared in the second volume of Darwin&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s book The Botanic Garden, titled The Loves of the Plants. This was the atmosphere in which the younger Darwin grew up.<br><br>But within a year or two of his return from the Beagle, Darwin felt forced, on theoretical grounds, to question the idea of self-�fertilization. In an 1837 notebook, he wrote, &#x201c;Do not plants which have male and female organs together yet receive influence from other plants?&#x201d; If plants were ever to evolve, he reasoned, cross-�fertilization was crucial&#x2014;�otherwise, no modifications could ever occur, and the world would be stuck with a single, self-�reproducing plant instead of the extraordinary range of species it actually had. In the early 1840s, Darwin started to test his theory, dissecting a variety of flowers (azaleas and rhododendrons among them) and demonstrating that many of these had structural devices for preventing or minimizing self-�pollination.<br><br>But it was only after On the Origin of Species was published in 1859 that Darwin could turn his full attention to plants. And where his early work was primarily as an observer and a collector, experiments now became his chief way of obtaining new knowledge.<br><br>He had observed, as others had, that primrose flowers came in two different forms: a &#x201c;pin&#x201d; form with a long style&#x2014;�the female part of the flower&#x2014;�and a &#x201c;thrum&#x201d; form with a short style. These differences were thought to have no particular significance. But Darwin suspected otherwise, and examining bunches of primroses that his children brought him, he found that the ratio of pins to thrums was exactly one to one.<br><br>Darwin&#x2019;s imagination was instantly aroused: a one-�to-�one ratio was what one might expect of species with separate males and females&#x2014;�could it be that the long-�styled flowers, though hermaphrodites, were in the process of becoming female flowers and the short-�styled ones male flowers? Was he actually seeing intermediate forms, evolution in action? It was a lovely idea, but it did not hold up, for the short-�styled flowers, the putative males, produced as much seed as the long-�styled, &#x201c;female&#x201d; ones. Here (as his friend T. H. Huxley would have put it) was &#x201c;the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.&#x201d;<br><br>What, then, was the meaning of these different styles and their one-�to-�one ratio? Giving up theorizing, Darwin turned to experiment. Painstakingly, he tried acting as a pollinator himself, lying facedown on the lawn and transferring pollen from flower to flower: long-�styled to long-�styled, short-�styled to short-�styled, long-�styled to short-�styled, and vice versa. When seeds were produced, he collected and weighed them and found that the richest crop of seeds came from the crossbred flowers. He concluded that heterostyly, in which plants have styles of different length, was a special device that had evolved to facilitate outbreeding and that crossing increased the number and vitality of seeds (he called this &#x201c;hybrid vigour&#x201d;). Darwin later wrote, &#x201c;I do not think anything in my scientific life has given me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure of these plants.&#x201d;<br><br>Although this subject remained a special interest of Darwin&#x2019;s (he published a book on it in 1877, The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species), his central concern was how flowering plants adapted themselves to using insects as agents for their own fertilization. It was well known that insects were attracted to certain flowers, visited them, and could emerge from blossoms covered with pollen. But no one had thought this was of much importance, since it was assumed that flowers were self-�pollinated.<br><br>Darwin had already become suspicious of this by 1840, and in the 1850s he set five of his children to work plotting the flight routes of male humble bees. He especially admired the native orchids that grew in the meadows around Down, so he started with those. Then, with the help of friends and correspondents who sent him orchids to study, and especially Hooker, who was now director of Kew Gardens, he extended his studies to tropical orchids of all kinds.<br><br>The orchid work moved quickly and well, and in 1862 Darwin was able to send his manuscript to the printers. The book had a typically long and explicit Victorian title, On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects. His intentions, or hopes, were made clear in its opening pages:<br><br>In my volume &#x201c;On the Origin of Species&#x201d; I gave only general reasons for the belief that it is an almost universal law of nature that the higher organic beings require an occasional cross with another individual. . . . I wish here to show that I have not spoken without having gone into details. . . . This treatise affords me also an opportunity of attempting to show that the study of organic beings may be as interesting to an observer who is fully convinced that the structure of each is due to secondary laws, as to one who views every trifling detail of structure as the result of the direct interposition of the Creator.<br><br>Here, in no uncertain terms, Darwin is throwing down the gauntlet, saying, &#x201c;Explain that better&#x2014;�if you can.&#x201d;<br><br>Darwin interrogated orchids, interrogated flowers, as no one had ever done before, and in his orchid book he provided enormous detail, far more than is to be found in the Origin. This was not because he was pedantic or obsessional but because he felt that every detail was potentially significant. It is sometimes said that God is in the details, but for Darwin it was not God but natural selection, acting over millions of years, which shone out from the details, details that were unintelligible, senseless, except in the light of history and evolution. His botanical researches, his son Francis wrote,<br><br>supplied an argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised as to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the consequent impossibility of their having been developed by means of natural selection. His observations on Orchids enabled him to say: &#x201c;I can show the meaning of some of the apparently meaningless ridges and horns; who will now venture to say that this or that structure is useless?&#x201d;<br><br>In a 1793 book titled The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilization of Flowers Discovered, the German botanist Christian Konrad Sprengel, a most careful observer, had noted that bees laden with pollen would carry it from one flower to another. Darwin always called this a &#x201c;wonderful&#x201d; book. But Sprengel, though he drew close, missed the final secret, because he was still wedded to the Linnaean idea of flowers as self-�fertilizing and thought of flowers of the same species as essentially identical. It was here that Darwin made a radical break and cracked the secret of flowers, by showing that their special features&#x2014;�the various patterns, colors, shapes, nectars, and scents by which they lured insects to flit from one plant to another, and the devices which ensured that the insects would pick up pollen before they left the flower&#x2014;�were all &#x201c;contrivances,&#x201d; as he put it; they had all evolved in the service of cross-�fertilization.<br><br>What had once been a pretty picture of insects buzzing about brightly colored flowers now became an essential drama in life, full of biological depth and meaning. The colors and smells of flowers were adapted to insects&#x2019; senses. While bees are attracted to blue and yellow flowers, they ignore red ones, because they are red-�blind. On the other hand, their ability to see beyond the violet is exploited by flowers which use ultraviolet markings&#x2014;�the honey guides that direct bees to their nectaries. Butterflies, with good red vision, fertilize red flowers but may ignore the blue and violet ones. Flowers pollinated by night-�flying moths tend to lack color but to exude their scents at night. And flowers pollinated by flies, which live on decaying matter, may mimic the (to us) foul smells of putrid flesh.<br><br>It was not just the evolution of plants but the coevolution of plants and insects that Darwin illuminated for the first time. Thus natural selection would ensure that the mouth parts of insects matched the structure of their preferred flowers&#x2014;�and Darwin took special delight in making predictions here. Examining one Madagascan orchid with a nectary nearly a foot long, he predicted that a moth would be found with a proboscis long enough to probe its depths; decades after his death, such a moth was finally discovered.<br><br>The Origin was a frontal assault (delicately presented though it was) on creationism, and while Darwin had been careful to say little in the book about human evolution, the implications of his theory were perfectly clear. It was especially the idea that man could be regarded as a mere animal&#x2014;�an ape&#x2014;�descended from other animals that had provoked outrage and ridicule. But for most people, plants were a different matter&#x2014;�they neither moved nor felt; they inhabited a kingdom of their own, separated from the animal kingdom by a great...</p><h2>All the Men/All the Women Compilation SC</h2><p><p>The Life and Times of All the Men and Women of the Bible Bringing together two books in one convenient volume, All the Men/All the Women of the Bible is a portrait gallery and reference library of over 3,400 named biblical characters.

He now resurrects searcher Wilson James, known as Wil, and his fellow traveler, the unnamed narrator, just in time to offer a positive spin on the Mayan prophecy for the year 2012. A mysterious Document is being released around the world with instructions on how to use powers of the mind and spirit to elevate world consciousness and usher in not doomsday but, rather, a time of unity and peace. Redfield suggests that current economic crises, religious extremism, and political polarization are signs that we must change our ways. But Wil, the narrator, and a band of neatly diverse seekers (a Jew, a Muslim, a scientist, a few Christians, and a few Native Americans) must attain enlightenment immediately (instant karma, anyone?) in order to stop a band of terrorists from detonating a suitcase nuke. Celestine-heads and others looking for miraculous fables will embrace this hokey yet hopeful spiritual action fantasy.

They remained in production deep into the 1980s, when overdrive-equipped transmissions finally eclipsed them. However, the C4 and C6 remain incredibly popular with enthusiasts, racers, and restorers alike due to their simplicity, strength, and low cost. <p>Rebuilding either of these transmissions isn't overly difficult, but does require care, some specialized tools, and proper procedure to be followed closely. In <i>How to Rebuild and Modify Ford C4 and C6 Automatic Transmissions</i>, author George Reid walks readers through the process step-by-step, from removing the transmission from the vehicle, to complete disassembly and cleaning, to careful reassembly, to proper re-installation and road testing. In addition, if the transmission will be used in a high-performance or competition situation, the author includes the various steps required to bolster the unit's strength, using commonly available aftermarket components. </p><p>Each chapter contains special notes, sidebars, and technical tips to assist the reader at every step in the process. Some refer to safety, others to time-saving advice, and others to small modifications that may aid long-term durability or help the builder tailor the shift firmness. The author's extensive research and experience with these popular transmissions has resulted in a well-rounded full-color technical guide to their revitalization.</p></p><p>Automatic transmissions aren&#x2019;t the easiest components to understand and service, but vintage Ford C4 and C6 3-speeds are among the simplest automatics ever designed. These Ford transmissions can be torn apart and rebuilt in your home garage or workshop using common hand tools. Very few specialized tools are required. This book reviews the long production life of both the C4 and C6 transmissions, and includes the various production changes you need to be aware of while building yours. Of these two popular Ford automatic transmissions, the C4 encompassed the most changes ranging from input shaft and forward clutch size to main case revisions, which means you will want to arm yourself with detailed information in order to build the best C4 possible, with the best sources for parts and accessories for these classic automatics. Because the larger, heavy-duty C6 transmission is the most rugged and dependable 3-speed automatic transmission Ford has ever produced, you can build even more durability and efficiency into yours. If high performance is your goal, advice, tips, and tricks are included to strengthen and fine-tune the capabilities of both the C4 and C6.George Reid has been a Ford enthusiast for more than 30 years.

There&#x2019;s really no escaping this nightmare. But for Clay, an arrow points the way home to his family in Maine, and as he and his fellow refugees make their harrowing journey north, they begin to see the crude signs confirming their direction. A promise of a safe haven, perhaps, or quite possibly the deadliest trap of all....</p><p>Witness Stephen King's triumphant, blood-spattered return to the genre that made him famous. <i>Cell</i>, the king of horror's homage to zombie films (the book is dedicated in part to George A. Romero) is his goriest, most horrific novel in years, not to mention the most intensely paced. Casting aside his love of elaborate character and town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very last page. <p> In <i>Cell</i> King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism. Mobile phones deliver the apocalypse to millions of unsuspecting humans by wiping their brains of any humanity, leaving only aggressive and destructive impulses behind. Those without cell phones, like illustrator Clayton Riddell and his small band of "normies," must fight for survival, and their journey to find Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. </p><p> Fans that have followed King from the beginning will recognize and appreciate <i>Cell</i> as a departure--King's writing has not been so pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal <i>Dark Tower</i> series and receiving a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either). "Retirement" clearly suits King, and lucky for us, having nothing left to prove frees him up to write frenzied, juiced-up horror-thrillers like <i>Cell</i>. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Now you can put this powerful resource to work in your search for fulfillment in your professional and personal life.</p><p>Larry Wilson is a case study in how the self-help business has "gone corporate." He founded Wilson Learning Corporation in 1965, sold that company, and in 1983 started Pecos River, a training and consulting firm specializing in "accelerating and facilitating individual and organizational change and growth." Pecos River is now Pecos River Change Management Division of Aon Consulting Worldwide, a firm that can trace its own lineage back to insurance tycoon and self-help maven W. Clement Stone's Combined Insurance Company of America. With a nod to Abraham Maslow and his theory of self-actualization, the Wilsons challenge readers to "thrive instead of survive," grow up emotionally and spiritually, and think in new ways. For them winning is not beating out others but avoiding the mindset of simply "playing not to lose." Presented effectively in low-key, straightforward fashion, this book is based on techniques Wilson's firm has developed and utilized in work with more than 500,000 persons. <i>David Rouse</i></p><h2>Dragon Ball, Vol. 6</h2><p>In the frozen north, Goku&#39;s one-man fight against the Red Ribbon Army continues as he storms the perilous Muscle Tower!

Diamond Dave karate kick with Van Halen in "Jump"? Tawny Kitaen turning cartwheels on a Jaguar to Whitesnake's "Here I Go Again"? The Beastie Boys spray beer in "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party)"? Axl Rose step off the bus in "Welcome to the Jungle"?<br><br> It was a pretty radical idea-a channel for teenagers, showing nothing but music videos. It was such a radical idea that almost no one thought it would actually succeed, much less become a force in the worlds of music, television, film, fashion, sports, and even politics. But it did work. MTV became more than anyone had ever imagined.<br><br> <i>I Want My MTV</i> tells the story of the first decade of MTV, the golden era when MTV's programming was all videos, all the time, and kids watched religiously to see their favorite bands, learn about new music, and have something to talk about at parties. From its start in 1981 with a small cache of videos by mostly unknown British new wave acts to the launch of the reality-television craze with <i>The Real World</i> in 1992, MTV grew into a tastemaker, a career maker, and a mammoth business.<br><br> Featuring interviews with nearly four hundred artists, directors, VJs, and television and music executives, <i>I Want My MTV</i> is a testament to the channel that changed popular culture forever.<b> </b></p><p><br> <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>I Want My MTV </i></strong> </p><p>In their 2011 book <i>I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution</i>, authors Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum revisit the &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; of music videos, from 1981 to 1992, based on interviews with more than 400 people. As they learned, sometimes bad videos happen to great songs. Here are ten examples. </p> <p><strong> Psychedelic Furs, "Pretty in Pink" (1984; 1986)</strong> <br>One of the great songs of the &#x2018;80s, but as a video, it&#x2019;s a two-time dud. The original video, from 1981, was too dreary and claustrophobic to capitalize on MTV&#x2019;s emerging Anglophilia. Five years later, a new version, rerecorded and re-filmed for the John Hughes movie of the same name, lacked the snarl of the original; Andie, Blaine and Ducky should never have even bothered. <br></p> <p><strong> Fleetwood Mac, &#x201c;Hold Me&#x201d; (1982)" </strong> <br>Making a video in the desert is sweaty and difficult, especially with a band that can&#x2019;t stand one another: &#x201c;It was so hot, and we weren&#x2019;t getting along,&#x201d; Stevie Nicks recalls. &#x201c;Hold Me&#x201d; is like a sun-baked hallucination, with sand dunes, guitars, Magritte paintings, Nicks in five-inch platform heels, and an obligatory, early-1980s slow-motion shot of breaking glass. Director Steve Barron: &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t a good video.&#x201d; Producer Simon Fields: &#x201c;John McVie was drunk and tried to punch me. It was a [expletive] nightmare, a horrendous day in the desert.&#x201d; <br></p> <p><strong> Rick James, "Super Freak" (1982) </strong> <br>Not long after MTV launched with a nearly all-white playlist, Rick James decried the network as &#x201c;racist,&#x201d; charging that MTV&#x2019;s segregated programming was &#x201c;taking black people back 400 years.&#x201d; James was enraged that MTV refused to air &#x201c;Super Freak&#x201d;; in fairness to the network, this gully video, starring James and a multiracial array of hot messes in streetwalker garb, was more akin to Pootie Tang than, say, &#x201c;Billie Jean.&#x201d; Carolyn Baker, who was MTV's director of acquisitions, says, "As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV." <br></p> <p><strong> Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, &#x201c;The Message&#x201d; (1982)</strong> <br>In the concluding scene, two cops arrest Flash and his band mates, possibly for the crime of making this awful video. The lyrics describe and denounce the dangers of urban poverty &#x2013; so why are these rappers dressed like low-budget Michael Jacksons? &#x201c;An immortal song, but the video was pure ghetto,&#x201d; says Def Jam executive Bill Adler. &#x201c;Some of the earliest rap videos were <i>terrible</i>.&#x201d;<br></p> <p><strong> Bruce Springsteen, "Dancing in the Dark" (1984)</strong> <br>Springsteen is adorably dorky in his first-ever video appearance, no more so than during his infamous new-wave dance-off with audience plant Courtney &#x201c;Monica Geller&#x201d; Cox. Directed by famed filmmaker Brian DePalma, &#x201c;Dancing in the Dark&#x201d; was catnip to MTV&#x2019;s teen demo (girls in particular), but Springsteen's longtime manager, Jon Landau, says the singer had "mixed feelings" about the video: "It broadened Bruce's appeal, but the whole thing was slick and high gloss. Not a typical Bruce Springsteen thing." <br></p><strong> Billy Squier, &#x201c;Rock Me Tonite&#x201d; (1984)</strong> <br>There are only two videos which merit their own chapters in &#x201c;I Want My MTV,&#x201d; and this is one. Squier was a hard-rock superstar before he released this video, which he describes as &#x201c;diabolical.&#x201d; Here&#x2019;s the plot: Squier wakes up in a bed of silk sheets, puts on white drawstring pants, skips around his bedroom, grinds on the floor, rips off his t-shirt, then puts on a pink tank top, and collapses back on his silk sheets. Squier blames this video for ending his reign on the rock charts. <br><p></p><strong> U2, &#x201c;Pride (In the Name of Love)&#x201d; (1984)</strong> <br>There are three different video versions of U2&#x2019;s tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., and none did any favors to the song. The second was shot by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn, and in his defense, he directed it hurriedly, in the basement of a hotel near Heathrow Airport, before U2 flew to Japan. He uses closeups of the band&#x2019;s faces, mostly in profile and shadowed, until the end, when Bono frenetically shakes his grand mullet. Corbijn recalls that when the band&#x2019;s manager saw the video, &#x201c;he swore that I would never be allowed near U2 again with a film camera.&#x201d; <br><p></p> <p><strong> Prince, "Raspberry Beret" (1985)</strong> <br>For an artist at his zenith in the &#x2018;80s, Prince never quite figured out music videos. &#x201c;Raspberry Beret&#x201d; is the most egregious example of Prince-the-control-freak taking a perfectly bad idea--let&#x2019;s hire two animators to work around the clock on a tale about a girl in a hat!--and making it worse, by taking the twee animation and clumsily combining it with performance footage. Producer Simon Fields: "Prince would mess with directors. He&#x2019;d give them the impression that they&#x2019;d be in charge of the video, then halfway through he&#x2019;d go, 'Thank you,' take what he liked, and edit it himself." Much respect to his Liza Minnelli hairdo, however. <br></p><strong> Aretha Franklin, &#x201c;Freeway of Love&#x201d; (1985) </strong> <br>In this comeback hit for the Queen of Soul, it&#x2019;s difficult to decide which is the worst part of the video. Is it the performance footage, where Franklin and her band grin like someone&#x2019;s pointing a gun at them? The literally-translated lyrics, which show a pink Cadillac when Aretha sings &#x201c;Pink Cadillac,&#x201d; and a traffic jam when she sings &#x201c;city traffic&#x2019;s moving way too slow&#x201d;? Or is it the dance sequences, which seem to have been choreographed by Benny Hill? Let&#x2019;s say each.<br><p></p><strong> Pixies, "Velouria" (1990)</strong> <br>Not even Dave Kendall could like this one. In need of a last-minute video for the U.K.&#x2019;s influential <i>Top of the Pops</i> countdown show, the band--not exactly telegenic on its best day--is filmed in suuuuuper sloooowwwww moooooooootion running through a quarry. Any slower and they&#x2019;d be time traveling. One camera. One shot. That&#x2019;s it. Band. Running.

Once known, Freemasonry spread throughout the world and attracted kings, emperors, and statesmen to take its sacred oaths. It also attracted great revolutionaries such as George Washington and Sam Houston in America, Juarez in Mexico, Garibaldi in Italy, and Bolivar in South America. It was outlawed over the centuries by Hitler, Mussolini, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. But where had this powerful organization come from? What was it doing in those secret centuries before it rose from underground more than 270 years ago? And why was Freemasonry attacked with such intense hatred by the Roman Catholic church?<br>This amazing detective story answers those questions and proves that the Knights Templar in Britain, fleeing arrest and torture by pope and king, formed a secret society of mutual protection that came to be called Freemasonry. Based on years of meticulous research, this book solves the last remaining mysteries of the Masons&#x2015;their secret words, symbols, and allegories whose true meanings had been lost in antiquity. With a richly drawn background of the bloody battles, the opportunistic kings and scheming popes, the tortures and religious persecution throughout the Middle Ages, it is an important book that may require that we take a new look at the history of events leading to the Protestant Reformation.</p><p><b>John J.

All four volumes&#x2014;<i>Antifragile, The Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness, </i>and the expanded edition of<i> The Bed of Procrustes, </i>updated with more than 50 percent new material&#x2014;are now together in one boxed set.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>ANTIFRAGILE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;Startling . . . richly crammed with insights, stories, fine phrases and intriguing asides.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, many things in life benefit from disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls &#x201c;antifragile&#x201d; is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better. What is crucial is that the antifragile loves errors, as it incurs small harm and large benefits from them. Spanning politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine in an interdisciplinary and erudite style, <i>Antifragile</i> is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE BLACK SWAN</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;[A book] that altered modern thinking.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Times</i> (London)</b><br> &nbsp;<br> A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random and more predictable. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. In this groundbreaking and prophetic book, Taleb shows that black swan events underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives, and yet we&#x2014;especially the experts&#x2014;are blind to them.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;[<i>Fooled by Randomness</i>] is to conventional Wall Street wisdom approximately what Martin Luther&#x2019;s ninety-five theses were to the Catholic Church.&#x201d;&#x2014;Malcolm Gladwell, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Are we capable of distinguishing the fortunate charlatan from the genuine visionary? Must we always try to uncover nonexistent messages in random events? <i>Fooled by Randomness</i> is about luck: more precisely, about how we perceive luck in our personal and professional experiences. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill&#x2014;the markets&#x2014;<i>Fooled by Randomness</i> is an irreverent, eye-opening, and endlessly entertaining exploration of one of the least understood forces in our lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THE BED OF PROCRUSTES</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Taleb&#x2019;s crystalline nuggets of thought stand alone like esoteric poems.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> This collection of aphorisms and meditations expresses Taleb&#x2019;s major ideas in ways you least expect. <i>The Bed of Procrustes</i> takes its title from Greek mythology: the story of a man who made his visitors fit his bed to perfection by either stretching them or cutting their limbs. With a rare combination of pointed wit and potent wisdom, Taleb plows through human illusions, contrasting the classical views of courage, elegance, and erudition against the modern diseases of nerdiness, philistinism, and phoniness.</p><p><b>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</b> spent two decades as a trader and risk taker before becoming a full-time essayist and scholar focusing on practical, philosophical, and mathematical problems with chance, luck, and probability. His focus is on how different systems handle disorder. Taleb is currently Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at New York University&#x2019;s School of Engineering, but he spends most of his time in the intense seclusion of his study, or as a fl�neur meditating in caf�s.

What makes us live, buy, even love as we do? The answers are in the codes.<br><br>In <i>The Culture Code</i>, internationally revered cultural anthropologist and marketing expert Clotaire Rapaille reveals for the first time the techniques he has used to improve profitability and practices for dozens of Fortune 100 companies. His groundbreaking revelations shed light not just on business but on the way every human being acts and lives around the world. <br><br>Rapaille&#x2019;s breakthrough notion is that we acquire a silent system of codes as we grow up within our culture. These codes&#x2014;the Culture Code&#x2014;are what make us American, or German, or French, and they invisibly shape how we behave in our personal lives, even when we are completely unaware of our motives. What&#x2019;s more, we can learn to crack the codes that guide our actions and achieve new understanding of why we do the things we do. <br><br>Rapaille has used the Culture Code to help Chrysler build the PT Cruiser&#x2014;the most successful American car launch in recent memory. He has used it to help Procter &amp; Gamble design its advertising campaign for Folger&#x2019;s coffee &#x2013; one of the longest lasting and most successful campaigns in the annals of advertising. He has used it to help companies as diverse as GE, AT&amp;T, Boeing, Honda, Kellogg, and L&#x2019;Or�al improve their bottom line at home and overseas. And now, in <i>The Culture Code</i>, he uses it to reveal why Americans act distinctly like Americans, and what makes us different from the world around us. <br><br>In <i>The Culture Code</i>, Dr. Rapaille decodes two dozen of our most fundamental archetypes&#x2014;ranging from sex to money to health to America itself&#x2014;to give us &#x201c;a new set of glasses&#x201d; with which to view our actions and motivations. Why are we so often disillusioned by love? Why is fat a solution rather than a problem? Why do we reject the notion of perfection? Why is fast food in our lives to stay? The answers are in the Codes. <br><br>Understanding the Codes gives us unprecedented freedom over our lives. It lets us do business in dramatically new ways. And it finally explains why people around the world really <i>are</i> different, and reveals the hidden clues to understanding us all.</p><p>Dr. CLOTAIRE RAPAILLE is the chairman of Archetype Discoveries Worldwide and has used this decoding approach for thirty years. He is the personal adviser to ten high-ranking CEOs and is kept on retainer by fifty Fortune 100 companies. He has been profiled in many national media outlets, including <i>60 Minutes II</i> and on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> Sunday Styles section. He lives in Tuxedo Park, New York.<b><i>From the </i>Introduction<i> to </i>The Culture Code<i><br></i></b><br>The Culture Code is the unconscious meaning we apply to any given thing &#x2014; a car, a type of food, a relationship, even a country &#x2014; via the culture in which we are raised. The American experience with Jeeps is very different from the French and German experience because our cultures evolved differently (we have strong cultural memories of the open frontier; the French and Germans have strong cultural memories of occupation and war). Therefore, the Codes &#x2014; the meaning we give to the Jeep at an unconscious level &#x2014; are different as well. The reasons for this are numerous (and I will describe them in the next chapter), but it all comes down to the worlds in which we grew up. It is obvious to everyone that cultures are different from one another. What most people don&#x2019;t realize, however, is that these differences actually lead to our processing the same information in different ways. <br><br>My journey toward the discovery of cultural codes began in the early 1970&#x2019;s. I was a psychoanalyst in Paris at the time, and my clinical work brought me to the research of the great scientist Henri Laborit, who drew a clear connection between learning and emotion, showing that without the latter the former was impossible. The stronger the emotion, the more clearly an experience is learned. Think of a child told by his parents to avoid a hot pan on a stove. This concept is abstract to the child until he reaches out, touches the pan, and it burns him. In this intensely emotional moment of pain, the child learns what &#x201c;hot&#x201d; and &#x201c;burn&#x201d; means and is very unlikely ever to forget it.<br><br>The combination of the experience and its accompanying emotion create something known widely (and coined as such by Konrad Lorenz) as an imprint. Once an imprint occurs, it strongly conditions our thought processes and shapes our future actions. Each imprint helps make us more of who we are. The combination of these imprints defines us. <br><br>One of my most memorable personal imprints came when I was a young boy. I grew up in France, and when I was about four years old, my family received an invitation to a wedding. I&#x2019;d never been to one before and I had no idea what to expect. What I encountered was remarkable. French weddings are unlike weddings in any other culture I know. The event went on for two days, nearly all of which was spent around a large communal table. People stood at the table to offer toasts. They stood on<i> </i>the table to sing songs. They slept under the table and (as I later learned) even seduced one another under the table. Food was always available. People drank <i>le trou Normand</i>, a glass of Calvados that allowed them to make room for more food. Others simply went to the bathroom to vomit so they could eat more. It was an amazing thing to see as a child and it left a permanent imprint on me. Forever more, I would always associate weddings with gustatory excess. In fact, the first time I went to a wedding in America, I was taken aback by how sedate it was in comparison. Recently, when I remarried, my wife (who also grew up in France) and I held the kind of multi-day feast that meant &#x201c;wedding&#x201d; to both of us. <br><br>Every imprint influences us on an unconscious level. When the work of Laborit crystallized this for me, I began to incorporate what I learned from him into my clinical work in Paris, most of which was being done with autistic children (in fact, Laborit led me to the theory that autistic children do not learn effectively because they lack the emotion to do so). The subject of imprinting also formed the foundation of the lectures I gave during this time. After one particular lecture at Geneva University, the father of a student approached me.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Rapaille, I might have a client for you,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Always intrigued at the possibilities offered by another case, I nodded with interest. &#x201c;An autistic child?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, smiling, &#x201c;Nestl�.&#x201d; <br><br>At the time, focused on clinical and scholarly work, I barely understood what the word &#x201c;marketing&#x201d; meant. I therefore couldn&#x2019;t possibly imagine what use I would be to a corporation. &#x201c;Nestl�? What can I do for them?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We are trying to sell instant coffee in Japan, but we aren&#x2019;t having as much success as we would like. Your work on imprints might be very helpful to us.&#x201d;<br><br>We continued to talk and the man made me an extremely attractive offer. Not only were the financial terms considerable, but there was something promising about a project like this. Unlike my work with autistic children, where progress was painfully slow, this offer was a chance to quickly test theories I had developed about imprinting and the unconscious mind. It was an opportunity too good to pass up. I took a sabbatical and went off on my new assignment.<br><br>My first meeting with Nestl� executives and their Japanese advertising agency was very instructive. Their strategy, which today seems absurdly wrong but wasn&#x2019;t as clear-cut in the &#x2018;70s, was to try to convince Japanese consumers to switch from tea to coffee. Having spent some time in Japan previously, I knew that tea meant a great deal to this culture, but I had no sense of what emotions they attached to coffee. I decided to gather several groups of people together to discover how they imprinted the beverage. I believed there was a message there that could open a door for Nestl�.<br><br>I structured a three-hour session with each of the groups. In the first hour, I took on the persona of a visitor from another planet, someone who had never seen coffee before and had no idea how one &#x201c;used&#x201d; it. I asked for help understanding the product, believing their descriptions would give me insight into what they thought of it. <br><br>In the next hour, I had them sit on the floor like elementary school children and use scissors and a pile of magazines to make a collage of words about coffee. The goal here was to get them to tell me stories with these words that would offer me further clues. <br><br>In the third hour, I had participants lie on the floor with pillows. There was some hesitation among members of every group, but I convinced them I wasn&#x2019;t entirely out of my mind. I put on soothing music and asked the participants to relax. What I was doing was calming their active brain waves, getting them to that tranquil point just before sleep. When they reached this state, I took them on a journey back from their adulthood, past their teenage years, to a time when they were very young. Once they arrived, I asked them to think again about coffee and to recall their earliest memory of it, the first time they consciously experienced it and, if it was different, their most significant memory of it.<br><br>I designed this process to bring participants back to their first imprint of coffee and the emotion attached to it. In most cases, though, the journey led nowhere. What this signified for Nestl� was very clear. While the Japanese had an extremely strong emotional connection to tea (something I learned without asking in the first hour of the sessions), they had at the most a very superficial imprint of coffee. Most, in fact, had no imprint of coffee at all. <br><br>Under these circumstances, Nestl�&#x2019;s strategy of getting these consumers to switch from tea to coffee could only fail. Coffee could not compete with tea in the Japanese culture if it had such weak emotional resonance. Instead, if Nestl� was going to have any success in this market at all, they needed to start at the beginning. They needed to give the product meaning in this culture. They needed to create an imprint for coffee for the Japanese.<br><br>Armed with this information, Nestl� devised a new strategy. Rather than selling instant coffee to a country dedicated to tea, they created desserts for children infused with the flavor of coffee but without the caffeine. The younger generation embraced these desserts. Their first imprint of coffee was a very positive one, one they would carry throughout their lives. Through this, Nestl� gained a meaningful foothold in the Japanese market. Understanding the process of imprinting &#x2014; and how it related directly to Nestl�&#x2019;s marketing efforts &#x2014; unlocked a door to the Japanese culture for them and turned around a floundering business venture. <br><br>It did something much more important for me, however. The realization that there was no significant imprint for coffee in Japan underscored for me that early imprinting has a tremendous impact on why people do what they do. In addition, the fact that the Japanese did not have a strong imprint for coffee while the Swiss (Nestl� is a Swiss company) obviously did made it clear that imprints vary from culture to culture. If I could get to the source of these imprints &#x2014; if I could somehow &#x201c;decode&#x201d; elements of culture to discover the emotions and meanings attached to them &#x2014; I would learn a great deal about human behavior and how it varies across the planet. This set me on the course of my life&#x2019;s work. I went off in search of the codes hidden within the unconscious of every culture.<br><b><i>From </i>Chapter Two:<i><br> The Growing Pains of an <br>Adolescent Culture: The Codes for Love, Seduction and Sex<br></i></b><br>As you will learn throughout this book, the American culture exhibits many of the traits consistent with adolescence: intense focus on &#x201c;the now,&#x201d; dramatic mood swings, constant need for exploration and challenge to authority, a fascination with extremes, openness to change and reinvention, and a strong belief that mistakes warrant second chances. As Americans, we feel we know more than our elders do (for instance, we rarely consult France, Germany, Russia, or England on our foreign policy), that their answers are out of date (we pay little heed to the opinions of these cultures when it comes to global matters), and that we must reject their lessons and re-make the world (few of us &#x2014; including many of our leaders &#x2014; are students of world history, choosing to make our own mistakes rather than learning from the mistakes these other cultures have already made). <br><br>Like all adolescents, we are preoccupied with love, seduction, and sex. We are not unique in this regard. People in many cultures throughout the world are fascinated with these things &#x2014; perhaps more so than anything else. After all, as human beings, we need sex at the very least to ensure the continuation of our species. The unconscious attitudes we Americans hold about these matters, however, are unique and very much related to our cultural adolescence.<br><br>Adolescence is a time of confusion and contradictions. New discoveries are promising one day and disappointing the next. Dreams sprout, flower, and wilt as quickly as daffodils in the spring. Certainties become uncertainties in the blink of an eye. This is as true with adolescent cultures as it is with adolescent children and never is it clearer than in the Codes revealed in this chapter. <br><br>Some of you will find the following pages disturbing. Some of you will insist that you don&#x2019;t see yourself in these Codes in any way. (You might even be right about that. <i>Of course</i>, every individual is different, as he or she is also governed by his or her individual unconscious.) The revelation of the following Codes might be upsetting to you, but please remember that Codes are value-neutral. The Codes themselves do not pass judgment on a particular culture. The American Codes simply reflect our cultural adolescence. This is very good and empowering in many cases, as you will see in subsequent chapters, and explains why we are the best in the world at many things and why we have been such innovators and reformers. <br><br>If one were to compile a list of things at which the American culture excels, however, love, seduction, and sex would not be on that list. You know this already. After all, when we consider someone a great ladies&#x2019; man, we might call him a &#x201c;Don Juan&#x201d; or a &#x201c;Casanova.&#x201d; We will never, however, call him a &#x201c;Joe Smith.&#x201d; The function of the new set of glasses provided by the Culture Code is to show us <i>why </i>we do the things we do:<br><i><br>Why</i> are American women so concerned with finding &#x201c;Mr. Right?&#x201d;<br><i><br>Why </i>does the FCC frown on (and even prosecute) televising a woman breastfeeding, but allow the exhibition of fictionalized bloodbaths during network Prime Time?<br><i><br>Why </i>are American women offended when construction workers whistle at them in New York but flattered when a man does the same in Milan?<br><br>The answers are in the Codes.<br><br><b><i>What&#x2019;s love got to do with it?<br></i></b><br>I held imprinting sessions all over the country searching for the Code for love. During these sessions, I asked participants to focus on the word &#x201c;love&#x201d; without specifying whether I meant romantic love, parental love, sibling love, love of country, love of pets, or even love of a sports team. When I guided participants back to their first imprint though, a vast majority of them went to the same place.<br><br><i>&#x201c;My first experience with the word love, or related to love, was when I was four or five. In the kitchen, mother was preparing a cake, my favorite cake, a cheesecake. The smell was the smell of love. She opened the oven and I told her, &#x2018;I love you!&#x2019; She closed the oven, came to give me a kiss, and told me, &#x2018;I love you, too.&#x2019; Then she gave me a big portion of the cake and I knew she really meant it when she said, &#x2018;I love you&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>-- 40-year-old man<br><br>&#x201c;Mother loved us so much, she cooked all Thanksgiving day. She was so happy to see her family all together again, around the table, eating...so much love around the table, so much food. We could not stop eating.&#x201d;<br>-- 36-year-old woman<br><br>&#x201c;When you are little, parents are there to care for and protect you. You have no care or worries. If something bad happens, your family is there for you. I miss this protection.&#x201d;<br>-- 58-year-old woman<br></i><br><i>&#x201c;The best way to describe my parents&#x2019; room is a nest. The carpet was light brown and the walls were blue. The bed was in the center of the room and had a huge white comforter. It was on this bed that I sat with my mother as a child and asked her about the world.&#x201d;<br>-- 21-year-old man<br></i><br><i>&#x201c;I remember lying in my mother&#x2019;s lap in my early years. I remember talking with my mother and sharing caresses.&#x201d;<br>-- 65-year-old man<br></i><br>Consistently, participants related their first experience of love to their mother&#x2019;s care &#x2014; feeding them, holding them, making them feel safe. This is entirely understandable. After all, for nine months, our mothers provide us with the most perfect &#x201c;resort hotel&#x201d; imaginable. The room service is first-rate and available immediately upon demand, the space is neither too hot nor too cold, transportation is free, and there&#x2019;s even a musical backdrop (her heartbeat) for entertainment. And even though we ultimately must leave this vacation paradise, our mothers are there for us to guide us through the transition, feeding us with their bodies, keeping us coddled and warm, taking us out to see the world, and providing numerous ways for us to occupy our time and delight in the act of learning. <br><br>The nature of these responses was very consistent with the thinking of an adolescent culture. Adolescents, after all, flit from pressing for independence to acting like children throughout this period of their lives. When in the latter ...</p><h2>BETWEEN FRIENDS</h2><p><br><br>Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski. Two girls from very different backgrounds.

Born in 1948 in the same Washington State town, Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski have vastly different backgrounds. Wealthy Jillian is on a trajectory to become a lawyer like her father. Just as smart, but from the wrong side of the tracks, Lesley is destined to remain in their native Washington; like her mother, she becomes pregnant at a young age by an alcoholic philanderer. Despite their different circumstances, Jillian and Lesley forge a grade-school friendship that lasts a lifetime and is evoked in their various communiques. Macomber's storytelling is undermined by the ambitious choice of format. Rather than providing intimacy, the "just a short note" conceit deals superficially with the most significant events of the last 50 years (a quick perusal of the half-page e-mail devoted to the World Trade Center attack will be enough to confirm this) and with the characters themselves, who are somewhat thinly drawn. As for the lessons learned - it's generally easier to be rich than poor, it's never too late to take up golf - there's not much that's revelatory.

NO, as it is known by chemists, is a signaling molecule produced by the body, and is a vasodilator that helps control blood flow to every part of the body. Dr. Ignarro's findings led to the development of Viagra. Nitric Oxide has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system as well.</p><p>NO relaxes and enlarges the blood vessels, prevents blood clots that trigger strokes and heart attacks, and regulates blood pressure and the accumulation of plaque in the blood vessels. Dr. Ignarro's current research indicates that Nitric Oxide may help lower cholesterol by facilitating the actions of statin drugs like Lipitor. </p><p>The goal of the regimen presented in <i>NO More Heart Disease</i> is to age proof the cardiovascular system, keeping the vascular network clean and elastic through enhanced NO productivity. The plan is easy-to-follow without extreme lifestyle adjustments, involving taking supplements to stimulate Nitric Oxide production, incorporating NO friendly food into the diet, and a moderate exercise program.</p></p><p><p><b>Dr. Louis J.

She had dark brown hair that bled into gray at the roots, and hazel eyes with webs of crow&#x2019;s feet at the corners. She smiled at me, and her whole face moved.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning, Mara,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; I said back. My voice was low and hoarse. It didn&#x2019;t sound like my own.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know where you are?&#x201d;<br> <br>She obviously didn&#x2019;t realize that the floor directory was positioned directly outside the window behind her, and that from the bed, I had a clear view. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the Lillian and Alfred Rice Psychiatric Unit.&#x201d; Apparently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know who I am?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had no idea, but I tried not to show it; she wouldn&#x2019;t have asked me if we&#x2019;d never met, and if we had met, I should remember her. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s my name?&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn. My chest rose and fell quickly with my breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. West,&#x201d; she said evenly. Her voice was warm and friendly but not at all familiar. &#x201c;We met yesterday, when you were brought in by your parents and a detective by the name of Vincent Gadsen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yesterday.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>I remembered seeing my father lying pale and wounded in a hospital bed after he was shot by the mother of a murdered girl.<br> <br>I remembered that I was the one who made her do it.<br> <br>I remembered going to the police station to confess to stealing my teacher&#x2019;s EpiPen and releasing fire ants in her desk, which is why she died of anaphylactic shock.<br> <br>I remembered that it wasn&#x2019;t true&#x2014;just a lie I would feed the police so they would keep me from hurting anyone I loved again. Because they wouldn&#x2019;t believe I wished my teacher dead and that not long after, she died. Choked to death on a swollen tongue, exactly the way I imagined she would.<br> <br>I remembered that before I could tell anyone any of this, I saw Jude at the Thirteenth Precinct of the Metro Dade Police Department. Looking very much alive.<br> <br>But I did not remember coming here to the hospital. I didn&#x2019;t remember being brought. After Jude appeared, I remembered nothing else.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were admitted yesterday afternoon,&#x201d; the stranger&#x2014;Dr. West&#x2014;said. &#x201c;The detective called your parents when they couldn&#x2019;t get you to stop screaming.&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my eyes and saw Jude&#x2019;s face as he walked by me. Brushed past me. Smiled. The memory stained the backs of my eyelids, and I opened them quickly, just to see something else.<br> <br>&#x201c;You told them that your boyfriend, Jude Lowe, who you thought died in a building collapse in December, is alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ex,&#x201d; I said quietly, fighting to stay calm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ex-boyfriend.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. West tilted her head slightly and employed her carefully neutral psychologist expression, one I recognized well since I&#x2019;d seen it often on my psychologist mother. Particularly in the past few months.<br> <br>&#x201c;You said that you caused the abandoned asylum in Rhode Island to collapse, crushing your best friend, Rachel, and Jude&#x2019;s sister, Claire, inside. You said Jude sexually assaulted you, which is why you tried to kill him. And you said he survived. You said he&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was perfectly calm as she spoke, which magnified my panic. Those words in her mouth sounded crazy, even though they were true. And if Dr. West knew, then so did&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother brought you here for an evaluation.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother. My family. They would have heard the truth too, even though I hadn&#x2019;t planned to tell it. Even though I didn&#x2019;t remember telling it.<br> <br>And this was where it got me.<br> <br>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t begin yesterday because you were sedated.&#x201d;<br> <br>My fingers wandered up my arm, beneath the short sleeve of my white T-shirt. There was a Band-Aid on my skin, covering what must have been the injection site.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d; I asked, picking at the Band-Aid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My mother.&#x201d; My eyes scanned the hallway through the glass, but I didn&#x2019;t see her. The hall looked empty. If I could just talk to her, maybe I could explain.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not here.&#x201d;<br> <br>That didn&#x2019;t sound like my mother. She didn&#x2019;t leave my side once when I was admitted to the hospital after the asylum collapsed. I told Dr. West as much.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you like to see her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, we can see if we can work that out later.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her tone made it sound like that would be a treat for good behavior, and I didn&#x2019;t like it. I swung my legs over the bed and stood up. I was wearing drawstring pants, not the jeans I last remembered myself in. My mother must have brought them from home. Someone must have changed me. I swallowed hard. &#x201c;I think I want to see her now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. West stood up as well. &#x201c;Mara, she isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll go find her,&#x201d; I said, and started looking for my Chucks. I crouched to look under the bed, but they weren&#x2019;t there.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are my shoes?&#x201d; I asked, still crouched.<br> <br>&#x201c;We had to take them.&#x201d;<br> <br>I rose then, and faced her. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They had laces.&#x201d;<br> <br>My eyes narrowed. &#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You were brought here because your mother thought you may be a danger to yourself and others.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I really need to talk to her,&#x201d; I said then, struggling to keep my voice even. I bit down hard on my bottom lip.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be able to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d like you to speak with someone first, and have a doctor come in, just to make sure you&#x2019;re&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if I don&#x2019;t want to?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. West just looked at me. Her expression was sad.<br> <br>My throat wanted to close. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t keep me here unless I consent,&#x201d; I managed to say. I knew that much, at least. I was a lawyer&#x2019;s daughter and I was seventeen years old. They couldn&#x2019;t keep me here unless I wanted to be kept. Unless&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;You were screaming and hysterical and you slipped. When one of our nurses tried to help you up, you punched her.&#x201d;<br> <br>No.<br> <br>&#x201c;It became an emergency situation, so under the Baker Act, your parents were able to consent for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I whispered so I wouldn&#x2019;t scream. &#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but you&#x2019;ve been involuntarily committed.&#x201d;</p><h2>Horse Diaries #16: Penny</h2><p><b><b>For all lovers of horses and history!

Not that we had any wagons. They&#x2019;d been abandoned at the eastern edge of the mountains weeks ago, too heavy to pull up the steep slopes. The slow, plodding oxen could have made the climb, but&nbsp;there was nothing to feed them. People had just turned them loose.<br> Unlike them, I was quick and surefooted, able to forage for myself. I never strayed too far from camp, though, because the mountains were filled with strange predator tracks and smells.<br> I wasn&#x2019;t sure what my owner, Buckeye Jack, was looking for out here in the wilderness. But I didn&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;d find it at Luck&#x2019;s End. The town was just a single row of wood-frame buildings, all huddled close like a herd of cows in a snowstorm. Buckeye Jack tied my reins to a hitching post and lifted his grandson, Jesse, down from my back. The boy&#x2019;s freckled face was sunburned and smudged with dust.<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re here?&#x201d; he asked, looking around the nearly empty street. &#x201c;This is where the gold is?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not here in town, Jesse, but in the riverbeds of the valley,&#x201d; said Buckeye Jack. &#x201c;As soon as we get a few supplies, we&#x2019;ll set up camp.&#x201d; He left us and walked into a building with a false front that made it look bigger than it was. On the porch, two men with long white beards were playing a game of checkers.<br> Jesse sat down next to me at the edge of the wooden boardwalk. Across the street, a couple of men were loading a pile of feed sacks onto the back of a long-eared pack mule. As soon as one man hoisted a sack onto the mule from the left, the animal reached around to the right and grabbed the bag in its big teeth, slinging it back onto the pile. The men were so busy arguing about the proper way to load a mule that they didn&#x2019;t notice.<br>Jesse would have laughed at this once, but now he just sighed and rested his chin in his hands. I reached down to snuffle his rust-colored hair. Poor Jesse. . . . Both his parents had died in the cholera outbreak on the wagon train some months back. Now the only family he had left was his grandfather, Buckeye Jack. And me&#x2014;I tried to keep a watchful eye on him, as mares in a wild herd will do for an orphan foal.<br> Buckeye Jack came stomping out of the building with a bulging burlap sack slung over his shoulder. He looked even unhappier with his load than the mule did. &#x201c;That shopkeeper&#x2019;s as good as a thief!&#x201d; he said angrily to the men on the porch. &#x201c;Thirty-six dollars for a shovel that&#x2019;s not worth fifty cents, and two dollars for a single egg.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;True enough,&#x201d; drawled one of the men. He&nbsp;tilted his chair and spat a brown wad of tobacco juice over the edge of the porch. &#x201c;But what can we do? Ain&#x2019;t no other place to buy supplies within fifty miles.&#x201d;<br> Jesse jumped to his feet, his eyes wide and anxious. &#x201c;Will we starve?&#x201d;<br> Buckeye Jack forced a smile onto his face. &#x201c;A couple of Ohio wildcats like us? No, sirree. The shopkeeper gave us enough credit for a good canvas tent, a couple of tin pans, and enough vittles to last a few weeks. By then we&#x2019;ll have plenty of gold to buy every barrel of pork and pickles in the place.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And I can hunt,&#x201d; said Jesse. &#x201c;Papa showed me how before . . .&#x201d; He swallowed hard.<br> Buckeye Jack heaved the sack of supplies onto my back and fixed it in place with a rope wound&nbsp;around my belly. The sharp edge of something dug into my ribs. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d best make tracks to stake a claim before dark,&#x201d; he said as Jesse scrambled up in front of my cargo.<br> &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d outfoxed the other goldbugs by heading north instead of south to Sutter&#x2019;s Mill, where everyone expects to find another windfall,&#x201d; said Buckeye Jack as he led me down the dusty street. &#x201c;But it seems that plenty of others had the same idea.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Is there any gold left for us?&#x201d; asked Jesse. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry,&#x201d; said Buckeye Jack. He gave<br> me a friendly slap on the neck. &#x201c;This gold-and-white filly is our good-luck&nbsp; charm, remember? I knew it the minute I set eyes on her at Fort Kearney. And I won her from the major in a single game of blackjack, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but . . . we haven&#x2019;t had very good luck since then, have we?&#x201d;<br> Buckeye Jack didn&#x2019;t reply. The town disappeared behind us as we followed an overgrown path into the foothills. The sun burned low and orange in the sky, like the remains of a campfire, and the day&#x2019;s warmth was fading fast.<br>At the bottom, I regained my balance and shook my head to clear away the dust. I spotted Buckeye Jack getting stiffly to his feet nearby. His clothes were torn, and his hands were scraped raw. But he didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. He was gazing out across a small clearing that stretched before us. At its edge, a river flowed around scattered gray rocks.<br> &#x201c;Home, sweet home,&#x201d; said Buckeye&nbsp; Jack.<br> As we trekked across a narrow ridge, a pile of rocks gave way under Buckeye Jack&#x2019;s boots. He let out a yell and tumbled down the hillside, slabs of loose shale raining after him.<br> Jesse called out, but there was no answer. He turned me off the ridge and urged me down the steep bank. It was hard to keep my balance with the heavy pack swaying from side to side. I sat back on my haunches and held my front legs stiff in front of me as I slid.</p><h2>The Modern New Testament from Aramaic</h2><p>This is the deluxe study version of the modern New Testament as translated from the Aramaic.</p><p>Dr. George M.

An avid snowboarder, marathon runner, and Vinyasa yoga practitioner, she is dedicated to helping her patients live not just longer, but better lives.<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>&#x201c;Why am I so bloated?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a question I hear nearly every day in my gastroenterology practice. Over the course of my medical career, I&#x2019;ve gone from helping a handful of women a week with bloating, sluggish fullness, and constipation to feeling like I&#x2019;m dealing with a full-on epidemic. For many, the symptoms are daily, relentless, and life altering, but even when they&#x2019;re not that severe, they&#x2019;re always annoying.</p><p>The causes of bloating vary tremendously, from common benign conditions to rare, life-threatening illnesses. Some may be connected to behaviors you don&#x2019;t even think about. (Do you talk with your mouth full? You could be swallowing enough air to go up a dress size!) Some you may have heard of but need more information and aren&#x2019;t quite sure whether you should be worried. (Is celiac disease the same as gluten intolerance?) Some may surprise you. (Taking antacids to settle your stomach can make your jeans un-zippable!) In this book you&#x2019;ll learn about these issues and many more, including how to tell if your bloating is serious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or if you&#x2019;re just seriously bloated.</p><p><i>Your Inner Doctor</i></p><p>The information in this book incorporates aspects of both conventional and alternative medicine to create an intuitive, commonsense approach to digestive wellness. The goal is not to scare you into having an unnecessary procedure or taking a pill you don&#x2019;t need, but to encourage you to explore the cause of your symptoms and to implement some useful basic strategies, many of which are already in your toolbox.</p><p>I believe that buried deep beneath the information overload we all receive from consumer marketing is our own innate sense of what we need to make ourselves well. I like to call it our &#x201c;inner doctor.&#x201d; This book will help you access that deep inner sense, building your understanding by providing reliable information on what helps and what hinders when it comes to your digestive health.</p><p>Many digestive problems that a decade ago we thought were &#x201c;all in people&#x2019;s heads&#x201d; we now know are caused by very real gastrointestinal disturbances&#x2014;conditions like bacterial overgrowth and gluten intolerance. I refuse to believe that millions of women who suffer from bloating but don&#x2019;t have a diagnosis are &#x201c;crazy&#x201d; or &#x201c;just stressed out.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve seen how often, by thinking outside the box, we&#x2019;re able to find both the problem and the remedy.</p><p>I want to help you trust your inner doctor. If you think there&#x2019;s something going on, there probably is, and you need to keep searching till you find the right person who can help you figure it out. They may not always have a white coat on and an MD behind their name. Much of what I know I&#x2019;ve learned from patients, nutritionists, biofeedback practitioners, holistic health coaches, naturopathic doctors, acupuncturists, farmers, and even my yoga instructor. I hope the information in this book will serve as a guide to help you understand what&#x2019;s going on in your body and offer you some real solutions.</p><p><i>My Promise to You</i></p><p>I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time inside the digestive tract, observing what&#x2019;s gone wrong and why. This book contains the information I think is most important to share, in short, digestible (pardon the pun) chapters. When I don&#x2019;t know something, I&#x2019;ll tell you I don&#x2019;t know. When I think a particular practice is shady or suspect, I&#x2019;ll tell you that, too. I&#x2019;ll give you the information that has been helping my patients make real improvements in their digestive health&#x2014;including a comprehensive 10-Day Gutbliss Plan to heal yourself from the inside out, based on twenty years of experience. It&#x2019;s helped thousands of women tighten their tummies and end their discomfort. Many have reported a surge in energy and mood, too! This easy-to-follow integrative approach to digestive wellness will help you banish bloat, flush toxins, and dump your digestive baggage&#x2014;the healthy way.</p><p>The world these days can be an intimidating place. We worry about environmental toxins, drugs can be dangerous, and Mother Nature would hardly recognize much of what&#x2019;s available at the grocery store. But left to its own devices, the human body is still a marvel, with an amazing capacity to recover and heal itself, particularly when injurious practices are identified and stopped. My sincere hope is that you&#x2019;re able to use the information in this book to find your own gutbliss and that when you and I meet, it&#x2019;ll be at the farmer&#x2019;s market or on the yoga mat, and not in my office.</p><p><i>Finding My Gutbliss</i></p><p>In 2004 I decided to leave the hallowed halls of academia and set up my own practice. Georgetown Hospital had been my first job when I finished my training in New York in 1997, but after almost eight years, hospital-based medicine no longer seemed to have the answers my patients and I were looking for. I owed a lot to the institution&#x2014;my career had flourished there: I had a sixteen-page r�sum� of published articles, book chapters, and speaking engagements throughout the United States and Europe; I had helped to train over thirty gastroenterologists; I had colleagues I respected and admired; and I enjoyed the teaching opportunities. My salary was more than generous. My professional life was bountiful and I should have been happy, but I wasn&#x2019;t. I had lost my faith.</p><p>Over the years my priorities had gradually shifted from high-tech procedures that diagnose and treat disease to no-tech lifestyle modifications that prevent them. It was becoming difficult for me to emphasize the industry message in my speaking and teaching that colonoscopy saves lives (which it does) without giving equal billing to what I had come to believe: that diet and lifestyle were more important in achieving and maintaining digestive health than any procedure I could recommend. Philosophically, I felt a lack of alignment. I was interested in an integrative and more holistic approach to digestive diseases and I wanted that to be part of my message. My colleagues seemed more interested in technical innovation. Their mission and approach hadn&#x2019;t changed, but mine had.</p><p>The practice of gastroenterology had also changed and was feeling more and more like a business venture, with the patients as the consumers and endoscopy as the product. Many gastroenterologists now owned their own endoscopy units, as well as the pathology services used to process their biopsy specimens. While this allowed for better quality control and closer collaboration, it also greatly incentivized doctors to do more procedures and biopsies.</p><p>The gastroenterologists I knew were people who cared deeply about their patients, but many of them struck me as overly committed to doing procedures. I wanted to provide patients with equally relevant lifesaving information&#x2014;like the fact that switching to a plant-based diet can cut your risk for colon cancer in half; or that exercise and a low-fat diet can prevent gallstones&#x2014;not just perform procedures.</p><p>A screening colonoscopy takes from fifteen to thirty minutes to perform. The reimbursement to the physician when done in an outpatient facility that they own can be several times what they make for an office visit of the same length. It&#x2019;s not hard to do the math and see why the nature of my specialty was changing. The economics simply don&#x2019;t encourage problem solving and exploration beyond the endoscope.</p><p>At the same time that gastroenterologists are being incentivized to do more procedures and spend less time talking to patients, the nature of digestive illnesses is changing, too. We&#x2019;re seeing more conditions related to diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors, and diagnosing and treating those conditions requires more than just a quick endoscopy.</p><p>Not all gastroenterologists are singularly focused on the revenue stream that endoscopic procedures like colonoscopies provide. Many have the kind of medical practices that embrace more integrative solutions, educating their patients about the importance of dietary intervention and other preventive measures, and exploring alternative diagnoses, while performing endoscopy in a responsible manner.</p><p>But providing comprehensive digestive care is not always easy or straightforward. It requires extra time for us to sit down and talk with patients about what they&#x2019;re eating and how they&#x2019;re living. It requires research into things we&#x2019;re unfamiliar with, and consideration of the possibility that maybe our colleagues in the alternative medicine world know a thing or two. That kind of care means a lot of additional education in things we learned nothing about in medical school and that we can&#x2019;t touch and see with our endoscopes.</p><p>Thanks to the Internet, some patients know more about their digestive disorder than their gastroenterologist, although they may not have the tools and context that allow them to manage it. So they&#x2019;re turning to their yoga instructors, massage therapists, life coaches, and social network for medical advice. Visits to alternative practitioners outnumber visits to conventional doctors four to one, even though they usually aren&#x2019;t covered by insurance. Conventional gastroenterology, while flourishing in the realm of advanced procedures and screening of healthy populations, is falling short in providing people with what they really need: reliable information on how to achieve and maintain digestive wellness.</p><p>I knew these were vitally important issues that needed to be addressed with patients. But I was still spending most of my time doing procedures and prescribing complicated drugs with lots of side effects. My philosophy had changed; now my practice needed to change, too.</p><p><i>An Integrative Solution</i></p><p>In 2004, while pregnant with my first child and renovating a house down to the studs, I decided to open a practice that was more in line with my philosophy of an integrative approach to digestive disease. In addition to providing patients with resources in nutrition, stress reduction, and exercise, there were three basic principles I wanted to adhere to:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Ensure sufficient time with my patients to explore problems in detail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Abide by my belief that most people aren&#x2019;t crazy, even if their symptoms don&#x2019;t always make sense.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Make and keep a commitment to think outside the box.<p>I gave notice at Georgetown, found an ideal location, applied for a tax ID number, and opened my doors. I called the practice the Digestive Center for Women, although it turns out women aren&#x2019;t the only ones interested in more integrative solutions to their digestive troubles, and men constitute about 20 percent of our patients. I remained a voluntary faculty member at Georgetown and continued to perform procedures at the hospital, although the number of procedures was much lower than what I had previously been doing.</p><p>Slowly but surely, patients came.</p><p>Many of them had already been evaluated and diagnosed by very competent gastroenterologists. They didn&#x2019;t come because I was smarter than their last doctor; they came to have a dialogue and to get ideas and feedback on what they could do to improve their digestive health. We talked in detail about symptoms, test results, nutrition, and stress and the possible relationship among them. I didn&#x2019;t always have the answers, but I usually knew where to look.</p><p>I built an integrative practice that relied a great deal on the excellent skills of my collaborators: a biofeedback practitioner, integrative nutritionists, exercise physiologists, and referrals to practitioners in counseling, acupuncture, and massage.</p><p>I continued to see patients with complex problems related to Crohn&#x2019;s disease and ulcerative colitis, which had been my area of expertise at Georgetown. I found that these patients, too, benefited greatly from an integrative approach that included nutritional intervention and stress reduction.</p><p>My focus shifted from scientific papers in medical journals on the role of endoscopy to articles in yoga, health, and women&#x2019;s magazines on the role of diet and lifestyle in preventing and treating digestive diseases. My talks at national gastroenterology meetings were now about obesity and the gastroenterology practice of the future, which would incorporate cooking classes, biofeedback, meditation workshops, and exercise sessions, not just endoscopy facilities.</p><p>I was grateful for the opportunity to merge my personal beliefs with my professional practice and engage a larger audience with what I believed to be the truth about digestive health. I decided to write a book to share what I had learned over the years about how to achieve a blissful gut, and I enthusiastically began work on the outline and manuscript.</p><p>On the last day of my tenure on the governing board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), I pitched an idea for a nonprofit called Gutrunners, which would focus on improving digestive health through educating the public about the benefits of nutrition and exercise. I was delighted when the ASGE agreed to be the founding sponsor and provided a loan as seed money. Gutrunners incorporated as a nonprofit in the state of Maryland and I dove into my new role as executive director, race director, and fund-raiser, arranging races at national gastroenterology conferences and meeting with potential sponsors and participants. Life was very busy but filled with meaningful work that I loved.</p><p><i>Bliss</i>less</p><p>I had witnessed firsthand with many of my patients what happened when work-life balance was disrupted, but, ironically, I failed to see the warning signs in my own life.</p><p>Although my practice was incredibly rewarding, the decrease in the number of lucrative procedures relative to what I&#x2019;d been doing at Georgetown and the fact that I was in solo practice (i.e., there was no one with whom to share expenses) meant a drop in income.</p><p>My days at the office were long and I spent my nights working on the book, writing articles, and trying to get Gutrunners off the ground. It was thrilling to have founded an organization dedicated to the principles I believed in, but now I was responsible for running it, and in the hole personally for the loan amount, which was to be repaid to the ASGE within five years.</p><p>My schedule was a brutal six a.m.-to-midnight routine that was difficult to maintain. My leisurely daily runs and regular yoga practice fell by the wayside. I now only had time for occasional weekend warrior workouts that left me sore the next day and did little to improve my fitness level. My daughter was the joy of my life, but there was never enough time with her.</p><p>I had grown up eating fresh produce from my grandfather&#x2019;s farm and home-cooked meals every day and had continued those traditions in our household. But now dinner was frequently takeout and not always healthy. I didn&#x2019;t have time for lunch most days and was eating way too much sugary and starchy food for quick energy. Some days half my calories came from cookies. The more sugar I ate, the more of it I craved, and my consumption increased dramatically. I&#x2019;m not a coffee drinker so sugar became my caffeine, causing wide swings in my mood and blood sugar, which left me feeling even more tired.</p><p>I also started drinking champagne at night while I worked. I&#x2019;d not been much of a drinker in college, medical school, or the...</p></p><h2>God is More Than Enough: Foundations for a Quiet Soul</h2><p>In God Is More Than Enough, Jim Berg offers practical wisdom for overcoming the stresses of life and finding God&#39;s peace.

Some of the strongest influences on her creativity have been the wild Wisconsin seasons, canoeing the Brule River, picking blueberries with her grandmother, and digging through the snow with her brothers. She received the SCBWI Los Angeles International Conference Portfolio Grand Prize for her artwork, and <i>Miss Maple&#x2019;s Seeds </i>is her first picture book. She lives in Los Angeles, California.K-Gr 2-Miss Maple travels all summer looking for orphaned seeds that she can shelter and nurture until the following spring. Each one is treated like a treasured child, "all similar yet none the same." She teaches them what it means to be a seed and takes them on field trips to their natural habitats. At night, they are snuggled into cozy beds. When spring arrives, she releases them back out into the world where they can root and grow into whatever they are bound to be. Her repeated mantra, "Take care, my little ones, for the world is big and you are small," is as comforting and encouraging as Miss Maple herself. Though the text veers a bit toward cloying, the whole is masterfully redeemed by its visual charm. A rich palette of warm greens, burnt oranges, and peacock blues dominates the spacious watercolor and ink illustrations, which are completely enchanting. With her broad straw hat, full skirts, and kind face, Miss Maple is the perfect embodiment of a caregiver, whether sweeping the tree house porch, floating downriver with her charges in a green leaf boat, or flying home atop one of her large blue birds. Each page is filled with broad vistas, warm breezes, woodland creatures, and other whimsical imagery that cannot help but welcome readers into Miss Maple's world. With its positive message about the value of nurturing even the tiniest bit of the natural world, this book is simply wonderful.-Teri Markson, Los Angeles Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The feline is tops at identifying every, "Scratch scratch squeak" and "Clang crash crunch crunch." So, when she hears an unfamiliar, "grrrrrr," she knows this is not an everyday mouse or raccoon. In fact, it is a small bear with a rumbling tummy. The kindly Muffin offers up chocolate cake, donuts, and cookies to quiet the rumbles, but soon realizes that they have company. "It was an enormous bear. It smelled like the dumpster on a hot day and rumbled louder than the vacuum cleaner." After a thank you hug, it downs some rainbow sprinkles and exits with its baby through the back window as the sun rises. Muffin is ready for a nap after her exciting night shift just as the baker awakens to an inexplicable, jaw-dropping mess. The illustrations, rendered in acrylic, paint, cut paper, and markers with a palette of blues, black, orange, and yellow, are reminiscent of Don Freeman's work. The front endpapers feature a scrumptious array of iced buns, cookies, donuts, and eclairs, while the back ones show the remnants of the night's feast&#x2014;nothing but crumbs and a half-eaten donut near a small gray mouse exclaiming, "I love sprinkles!" VERDICT This is not only a winning read-aloud, but also an excellent choice to introduce a mystery unit or a mini-lesson on onomatopoeia or simile. Another hit from the creator of The Bear Ate Your Sandwich.&#x2014;Barbara Auerbach, Cairo Public Library, NY</p><h2>Love and Ruin: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES&nbsp;</i>BESTSELLER � The bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Paris Wife</i>&nbsp;brings to life the story of Martha Gellhorn&#x2014;a fiercely independent, ambitious woman ahead of her time, who would become one of the greatest war correspondents of the twentieth century.</b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>The Washington Post </i>� New York Public Library � <i>Bloomberg&nbsp;</i>�&nbsp;<i>Real Simple</i></b><br><br>In 1937, twenty-eight-year-old Martha Gellhorn travels alone to Madrid to report on the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War and becomes drawn to the stories of ordinary people caught in the devastating conflict.

They moved without sound, slinking up hidden ropes, never looking at one another or thinking of anything but the next moment&#x2019;s action. On cat&#x2019;s feet, they fell from the wall to the ground, passing invisibly through the shadows and creeping softly toward their target.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was like a symphony unfolding. Their plan was to take the guards one by one by slitting their throats. Then they would force the door beyond the veranda and climb the marble steps to the little girl&#x2019;s room. Mar�a del Carmen, she was called, ten years old and sweetly sleeping until a rope would gag her quickly and pillows would crush over her small face. Then to the master bedroom, where they would dispatch the last few guards. Everything would be done without firing a single shot. The general and his beautiful wife wouldn&#x2019;t need to stir even a little in their bed beyond the door, their bodies still as a painting by Vel�zquez, until death came.<br> &nbsp;<br> All of this had been set in motion, but then one of the guards turned suddenly and machine-gun fire cut the night. The assassins scattered, barely escaping with their lives. The general woke at the sound of gunfire, but after hearing from his men what had happened, he only stumbled back to bed. Attempts on his life were not rare and particularly not just then, when he was on the cusp of the thing he&#x2019;d waited for, as a tiger waits, just out of sight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five days later, the planned uprising in Morocco began. The general broadcast a message urging all military officers to join the insurgence and overthrow the Spanish government. Then he sent his wife and daughter into hiding in France, and was taken through the streets of Tenerife, where already the shooting had begun, to a waiting de Havilland Dragon Rapide. He wore civilian clothes and dark glasses and, by way of further disguise, had shaved off his familiar mustache.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was nothing after all this for the trim little plane to take flight, ferrying its passenger to North Africa, where he would prepare the army that would soon overtake mainland Spain. On the way, he donned his uniform, crisp khaki with a red-and-gold belted sash. And just like that, he became General Francisco Franco, newly escaped from exile. Ready to start a war the whole world would be forced to finish.<br> &nbsp;<br> And what was I doing then, at twenty-seven, when Franco made his play for Spain? Standing in a deepening shadow, as everyone was, whether they realized it or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> German troops had recently marched into the Rhineland, and the Nuremberg Laws were being enforced, banning Jews from marrying or bearing children with &#x201c;pure&#x201d; Reich citizens, restricting them from public schools and certain businesses, and essentially branding them, along with Afro-Germans and Gypsies, enemies of the <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i>, so the Nazis could protect their Aryan blood in a race-based state. It was all so shocking and so absolutely wrong. And yet you could almost pretend it wasn&#x2019;t happening by going on with your life and thinking it had nothing to do with you.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had lived in Paris on and off for years, trying to be a writer and also falling in love a lot, without being terribly successful at either. I was dying to write a character as glittering and sharp as Lady Brett from <i>The Sun Also Rises, </i>but since I couldn&#x2019;t, I would settle for trying to be her. I wore long skirts with knit sweaters and sat in caf�s smoking too much and crinkling my eyes and saying, &#x201c;Hello, darling,&#x201d; to near strangers. I ordered cocktails that were far too strong for me, and laughed at things that were desperate, and threw myself hard at experience, by which I mean married men. But the worst of it was walking home alone afterward under a smeary purple sky feeling not at all like Lady Brett but sad and lonely and thoroughly confused about what to do and who to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something was missing in my life&#x2014;in me&#x2014;and I thought writing could fill it or fix it, or cure me of myself. It was only a notion I had, but I&#x2019;d been following it faithfully, from St. Louis to New York, New York to Paris, Paris to Cannes, to Capri, and now to Stuttgart, where I meant to do research. I&#x2019;d recently begun a novel about a young French couple that would do bold and important things in the name of political pacifism&#x2014;go on strike with coal miners and endure the metal truncheons of the gendarmes, all in the name of social justice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story felt brave and serious to me when I was hunched over my notebooks in the Weltkriegsbibliothek, but there was a moment every day when I stepped out of the library and was confronted with the actual world. How na�ve and hopeless the idea of pacifism seemed when the streets were full of brownshirts.<br> &nbsp;<br> One day I was at the cinema when two Reich soldiers came through and dragged a young Jewish woman out of her seat in front of me and into the street by the back of her neck like a dog. The lights came down and the film reel began to spin, but I couldn&#x2019;t be still in my chair and be entertained, not now. Walking back to my pension, I startled several times as I caught my reflection in a shopwindow. I looked Aryan enough, with my blond waves and light blue eyes and strong straight nose. I&#x2019;d inherited my features from my parents, after all, who had easily passed as Protestant in anti-Semitic St. Louis. But there was Jewish blood in my family on both sides.<br> &nbsp;<br> From Stuttgart, I moved on to Munich, where things grew even darker and more ominous. I read about Franco&#x2019;s coup in Nazi newspapers, which recounted everything in a boasting, sneering way. The rapidly falling Republican regime was described as a pack of &#x201c;Red Swine Dogs,&#x201d; while Franco glowed, a prince of the Spanish people. Never mind that the government he and his henchmen were overthrowing was the product of the first democratic election in sixty years. Never mind that innocent people were being butchered so that a few could claim power and total dominion.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time I was back in Paris, Franco had declared martial law and vowed to &#x201c;unite&#x201d; Spain again at any cost, even if it meant slaughtering half the population. Most of Spain&#x2019;s military had joined the Nationalists, while untrained civilians struggled to defend cities and villages. Pamplona, �vila, Saragossa, Teruel, Segovia, and the whole of Navarre fell like dominoes before a month had passed. Anyone who spoke against the coup was a target. In the old Moorish city of Badajoz, the Nationalists marched almost two thousand into the Plaza de Toros&#x2014;militiamen and peasant farmers, women and children&#x2014;and opened fire with machine guns, leaving the bodies where they fell, and then pushing on to Toledo, where they would do the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Worse still were the terrible alliances being formed. Nazi Germany sent state-of-the-art Luftwaffe bomber planes and three thousand troops to Spain in exchange for mineral resources, raw copper and iron ore that would soon help Hitler with his own deadly goals. Submarines were sent and more bombers, hundreds of shiploads of supplies and skilled officers to train Franco&#x2019;s men and sharpen their ability to kill and torture.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mussolini came to Franco&#x2019;s aid as well, &#x201c;loaning&#x201d; him eighty thousand troops and forming the third deadly prong of the Fascist triangle. And just like that, after years of sinister plotting, and almost overnight, Europe was a different place, and a more threatening one. It seemed anything could happen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stalin in the Soviet Union had his own agenda, but for the moment there was much to be gained by aiding Republican Spain. He waited to be joined by the major democracies in the West with arms to sell, but France&#x2019;s government was bitterly divided, and Britain seemed more concerned with the salacious happenings between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. In the States, Roosevelt was busy trying to manage the crippling effects of the Depression and also in the throes of his reelection campaign. And after all, there was much for America to debate in regard to Spain&#x2019;s pleas for help. There were troubling rumors of arms being given to anarchists and labor-union militias if they would join the Republic&#x2019;s cause&#x2014;a difficult stance to support when there was already so much fear at home about communism.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roosevelt decided on a blanket arms embargo, vowing to keep America out of foreign wars as long as possible. But for some of us who watched the shadows deepen all through that fall of 1936, there was no such thing as a foreign war. Nationalist forces spread through innocent villages, killing tens of thousands as they went. As they shelled the capital of Madrid, surrounding it on three sides, we felt responsible. The Republic of Spain had tried for democracy only to be slashed down and tortured. Why was it not our concern?<br> &nbsp;<br> Slowly, slowly, and then all at once, thousands of people began to come forward as volunteers. International Brigades were formed out of troops from France and America, Canada, Australia, Mexico. Most of the men weren&#x2019;t trained soldiers. Most, in fact, had never held a gun, and yet they grabbed what weapons they could&#x2014;revolvers their fathers had left them, hunting guns, pistols, gas masks from the hardware store&#x2014;and boarded trains, ships, cargo planes.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a beautiful crusade, and though I wasn&#x2019;t immediately sure how I would find a role for myself, later I thought only this:&nbsp;<br> It may be the luckiest and purest thing of all to see time sharpen to a single point. To feel the world rise up and shake you hard, insisting that you rise, too, somehow. Some way. That you come awake and stretch, painfully. That you change, completely and irrevocably&#x2014;with whatever means are at your disposal&#x2014;into the person you were always meant to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> For me the war in Spain will always shine with the light of hard-won transformation. It was like falling in love. Or looking up into the sky to see a burning arrow, which screamed to be followed. It was that simple and complicated all at once. And if more would be set in motion than I could possibly predict or even imagine, I was still ready to say yes. And if I would soon lose my heart forever, never to retrieve it, lose absolutely everything&#x2014;I was ready for that, too. My life seemed to be demanding it. It was calling me forward. There wasn&#x2019;t any choice to be made, in the end. I would have to go to it, with my eyes wide open, and my hands open, too, willing to pay the price.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Santa&#39;s Husband</h2><p><p>Offering a fresh twist on Kris Kringle, a clever yet heartfelt book that tells the story of a black Santa, his white husband, and their life in the North Pole.</p><p>Everyone knows that Santa Claus is jolly, but in <em>Santa&#x2019;s Husband</em>, this cherished symbol of the holiday season is also black and gay, and married to an equally cheery man.</p><p>In this witty and sweet illustrated Christmas tale, humor writer Daniel Kibblesmith introduces us to Mr. and Mr. Claus, and gives us a glimpse of their lives together.

But her gilded life took a dark yet fascinating turn in the past decade, when she became embroiled in a scandal that dominated the headlines in France. <br><br>The Bettencourt Affair, as it came to be called, started as a family drama but quickly became a massive scandal, uncovering L'Or�al's shadowy corporate history and buried World War II secrets. It all began when Liliane met Fran�ois-Marie Banier, an artist and photographer who was, in his youth, the toast of Paris and a prot�g� of Salvador Dal�. Over the next two decades, Banier was given hundreds of millions of dollars in gifts, cash, and insurance policies by Liliane. What, exactly, was their relationship? It wasn't clear, least of all to Liliane's daughter and only child, Fran�oise, who became suspicious of Banier's motives and filed a lawsuit against him. But Banier has a far different story to tell. . . .</p><p><b>Tom Sancton</b> was a longtime Paris bureau chief for <i>Time</i> magazine, where he wrote more than fifty cover stories. He first broke the Bettencourt Affair for many American readers with his feature piece in <i>Vanity Fair</i> in 2010. Sancton coauthored the <i>New York Times</i> (and international) bestseller <i>Death of a Princess</i>, a probing investigation of the murky circumstances behind Princess Diana's death. He has also written for <i>Fortune, Reader's Digest, Newsweek</i>, and other leading magazines. A Rhodes scholar who studied at Harvard and Oxford, he is currently a research professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he spends part of the year. In 2014, the French government named Tom Sancton a Chevalier (Knight) of the Order of Arts and Letters.Chapter 1<br><br> The Founder<br><br> Charles Schueller never expected to be a soldier. Six months earlier, the young man had been a cook in his native Alsace, France's easternmost province. Now he was huddled with 15,000 Garde nationale volunteers in the town of Belfort, trying to defend its heavily fortified citadel against the far larger German force that had besieged them. More accustomed to wielding a frying pan than a rifle, Schueller, like his comrades in the ill-equipped and untrained band, mainly tried to survive until hoped-for reinforcements could arrive. Meanwhile, the Germans pummeled the citadel with their Krupp six-pound field guns, the long-range, rapid-firing weapons that had been decimating French troops ever since the Franco-German war broke out in July 1870.<br><br> The conflict had been triggered by a trivial diplomatic incident about which Charles Schueller, the twenty-two-year-old son of a shoemaker, understood nothing. What he did understand was that la patrie was being invaded by the Germans and his beloved Alsace was on the front lines. Like most German-speaking Alsatians, Schueller was a fervent French patriot who would rather die than live under German occupation. The Belfort volunteers-les mobiles-held out until February 18, 1871, three weeks after officials in Paris had capitulated and signed an armistice. Their commander, Col. Pierre Denfert-Rochereau, was thereafter hailed as "the Lion of Belfort" for leading the heroic resistance.<br><br> The Franco-German war had far-reaching consequences. Germany was unified under Prussian leadership. The French Second Empire collapsed when the dyspeptic Emperor Napoleon III, unwisely venturing onto the battlefield, was captured and imprisoned. Most important for Charles Schueller, the triumphant Germans annexed Alsace and Lorraine.<br><br> Schueller moved to Paris in 1871 in order to remain French. He knew no one in the capital, but soon met and wed Am lie Denisot, daughter of a toolmaker from Burgundy, who worked as a domestic servant for a baker. Shortly after their marriage, they bought a pastry shop on the rue du Cherche-Midi. It was there, on March 20, 1881, at nine a.m., that Am lie gave birth to Eug ne Schueller in a back room. Eug ne was lucky: He was the only one of their five children who survived.<br><br> It was an inauspicious beginning for a man who was destined to build one of the world's great fortunes. "Life was very rude and very hard for us," he wrote in a biographical r sum , "and it's in this atmosphere of effort and work that I was raised, under the example of my hardworking parents." Before he went to school each day, he would rise early to help prepare the pastries, an apprenticeship that pointed to a future in the family business.<br><br> But the collapse of the Panama Canal Company in 1891 wiped out the couple's savings and forced them to move to the cheaper suburb of Levallois-Perret, where they bought another pastry shop. That turned out to be a big break for Eug ne: His parents supplied bread to the nearby Coll ge Sainte-Croix de Neuilly, an elite private school, which agreed to admit the boy as a student.<br><br> Eug ne earned top grades in all his classes before moving on to the Lyc e Condorcet in Paris, another elite school. There again, he excelled in his studies. After taking his Baccalaur at degree-roughly equivalent to two years of college-he entered the Institute of Applied Chemistry, where, as he said with typical immodesty, "I succeeded brilliantly and finished first in my class." Following his graduation in 1904, he took a position as a laboratory assistant to Professor Victor Auger at the Sorbonne. That seemed to map out a respectable but hardly lucrative career as a university researcher.<br><br> But then something happened that would change his life. The owner of a large barbershop visited Auger seeking help in developing a synthetic hair dye. At the time hair dyes were not widely used by Frenchwomen, largely because most of the lead-based concoctions that existed were toxic and irritated the scalp. The products were held in such ill repute that the Baroness de Staffe, a sort of nineteenth-century French Miss Manners, wrote in 1893 that their use "damages the brain and the eyesight." Schueller agreed to become the barber's technical adviser, working three hours each evening for 50 francs a month-a modest sum equal to about $260 today.<br><br> Even then the ambitious young man chafed at the idea of working under someone else�s orders. He soon cut ties with the barber and struck out on his own. Starting with a capital of 800 francs-roughly $4,000 in today�s money-he began experimenting with hair dyes in a rented space near the Tuileries Gardens, a vast park laid out in the mid-seventeenth century by the landscape architect Andr Le N&#x2122;tre, who also created the matchless perspectives surrounding the Ch&#x2030;teau de Versailles. A photo from this period shows Schueller sitting next to some kind of mechanical contraption, looking studious with an open book in his hand, dressed stiffly in a black suit and bow tie, his dark wavy hair swept back from his high forehead, and sporting a black mustache. What doesn�t show in the black-and-white photo is the intensity of Schueller�s blue eyes, one of his most striking and defining features.<br><br> His first efforts were disappointing, and his attempts to sell his products to hairdressers got nowhere. "It was a very difficult time," he wrote. "I lived alone, cooked my own meals, and slept in a little camp bed in my laboratory, and when I think back on these days, I wonder how I got through it." But he persisted, continuing his experiments, changing formulas, even trying the dyes out on his own hair. "Finally, I had the good fortune, which I think I deserved, to obtain a product of excellent quality that allowed me at last to launch my company."<br><br> In 1909, he founded the Soci t fran aise de teintures inoffensives pour cheveux-the French Company of Inoffensive Hair Dyes-a mouthful that he soon changed to L'Or al. The new corporate name was a homonym for the brand of Schueller's first product, "Aur ale," based on a popular hairstyle of the period and playing on the word aur ole, or halo. He could not know it then, but his little business would in time become the world's largest cosmetics firm and generate the enormous fortune that his yet-unborn daughter would one day inherit.<br><br> Things moved quickly after that. The same year as he founded L'Or al, Schueller married a young piano teacher named Louise Madeleine Berthe Doncieux, better known as "Betsy." The couple moved to a larger apartment on the rue du Louvre, near the celebrated museum, where Schueller also set up his laboratory, his office, and his first store. An influx of capital from a new partner and the hiring of a full-time salesman-a former hairdresser for the Imperial Russian court-allowed Schueller to expand his activities. He created a hair-dyeing school, recruited representatives to market the product outside of Paris, launched a promotional magazine, and commissioned a well-known artist, Raoul Vion, to create his first poster: It depicted a blond woman whose hair took the sweeping form of a comet, the first graphic image of a brand whose reputation spread quickly around the country.<br><br> Schueller was an obsessive worker and a restless thinker. As if running his company was not enough to occupy his mind, he was forever probing new ideas about the organization of industry, the economy, and politics. In his early days, he dabbled with Socialist ideas under the influence of his friend Jacques Sadoul, an ex-schoolmate from the Coll ge Saint-Croix and a future member of the French Communist Party. Around 1910, he became a Freemason, briefly immersing himself in the secret cult of intellectual humanism before leaving it three years later. (He would later become a visceral opponent of Freemasonry-along with Jews and republicanism.)<br><br> Schueller's philosophical ruminations, like his business activities, were rudely interrupted on August 1, 1914, by the onset of the First World War. Like his Alsatian father before him, Schueller was determined to fight for his country but, at the mature age of thirty-three, he was assigned auxiliary status. He volunteered for active duty in the army, but was only offered a post as a chemist in an armaments factory. He continued to demand a combat role and finally succeeded in joining the 31st Artillery Regiment of Le Mans. Sent to the front as a liaison officer, he distinguished himself at Verdun, l'Aisne, and other major battles. Schueller's wartime service won him five citations for valor, the L gion d'honneur, and the Croix de guerre, France's highest military decoration. One citation described him as a "peerless liaison officer" remarkable for his "vigor," his "boldness," and his "contempt for danger."<br><br> During Schueller's four-year absence from the helm of L'Or al, his wife, Betsy, had run the company so capably that he found his business "flourishing" upon his return from the army in 1919. Her performance could have led Schueller to give her a more active role in the business. But he was a product of his times who considered a woman's place to be in the home, not on the shop floor or the corner office. (In France at that time, women were legally treated as minors who had no vote and only limited property rights.) So Betsy returned to her piano, her homemaking, and, before long, her childrearing: On October 21, 1922, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Liliane Henriette Charlotte Schueller, future heiress to one of France's greatest fortunes.<br><br> Meanwhile, the 1920s were roaring. In France, as in America, it was the Jazz Age, and women�s styles were changing from the staid prewar fashions: Hemlines were higher, dresses more clinging, and, thanks largely to the influence of Coco Chanel, women started wearing their hair shorter. That was good news for Eug ne Schueller: Shorter hair was easier to dye, and the emancipated spirit of the times freed women to change their color, something that in an earlier era was frowned on by respectable ladies. As the stock markets rose feverishly around the world, L�Or al�s business boomed. Its products were now exported to Italy, England, Holland, even crossing the Atlantic to the United States and Brazil. By 1921, the company had permanent offices in London and New York, in addition to the Paris headquarters at 14 rue Royale, near the Madeleine church.<br><br> Emboldened by the success of his core business, Schueller began seeking opportunities in areas apart from L'Or al. Shortly after his return from the war, a manufacturer of hair combs sought his advice on a way to increase production of celluloid. Thanks to what Schueller called his "opportune invention" to speed the manufacturing process, the celluloid company increased production tenfold and Schueller became a partner. After engineering a merger with a plastics firm in 1925, he became the director of the new Soci t industrielle des mati res plastiques. Two years later, following a falling-out with his partners, he negotiated his departure in exchange for their shares in an American company, the Valstar Corporation, a manufacturer of paint and varnish. Schueller thus found himself the director and largest shareholder of Valentine, Valstar's French subsidiary. Around the same time, working with the Lumi re brothers, the legendary cinema pioneers, Schueller created a Lyon-based firm called Plavic Film, which manufactured film for movie and still cameras.<br><br> Not all of Schueller's adventures succeeded as well as L'Or al. Invited by the new Soviet government to set up a plastics factory near Moscow, Schueller made several trips to Russia between 1926 and 1928, but the experience was a disaster: The promised factory site was far from the capital, the workers' unions interfered with production, and in 1932 the government took over the company. The experience left Schueller, despite his earlier Socialist leanings, with a profound distrust of unions and anything smacking of Bolshevism.<br><br> In 1928 he agreed to take over a failing soap manufacturer called Monsavon. But the French soap market was saturated with competitors at the time and Schueller found it almost impossible to sell his product. At one point, he was spending 300,000 francs (worth about $1.5 million today) a month out of his own pocket and even had to mortgage his properties to keep the company afloat. Working with the fledgling Publicis advertising agency, created in 1926 by Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, Schueller launched a massive publicity campaign, based on radio spots, posters, and newspaper and magazine ads.<br><br> In a pitch aimed especially at the rural population, Schueller added milk to the soap formula and circulated posters showing mother cows washing their calves with Monsavon and mooing: "There is nothing better than milk." Another sales tactic was to persuade the French that they were dirty and did not wash enough. Schueller instructed his sales force to "tell people that they're disgusting, they don't smell good and they're not beautiful." The image of the unwashed French multitudes apparently had some basis in fact. In his 1869 travel book, Innocents Abroad, Mark Twain complained that the people of Marseille, a soap-making center, "never . . . wash with their soap themselves." A report by the Rockefeller Foundation, which sent a mission to France to fight a tuberculosis epidemic after World War I, lamented "the indifference of public opinion on questions of hygiene."<br><br> The results of Schueller's campaign were impressive: By 1939 Monsavon was on the verge of becoming the biggest soap company in France. Schueller was way ahead of his time in his use of advertising, particularly radio ads, to sell his products. He hired composers and singers to create catchy jingles, created simulated conversations vaunting the merits of his products, and staged spectacular events like hanging a 10,000-square-meter canvas on the fa ade of a Parisian building, hawking L'Or al's O'Cap hair lotion. Jingles for the company's Dop shampoo and Ambre Solaire suntan lotion became classics in the promotional genre. In 1933, Schueller created a slick monthly magazine called Votre Beaut , which he ran in his typical hands-on fashion, approving the layouts, editing the articles, and even writing some of them himself.<br><br> Even as his affairs prospered, Eug ne Schueller could hardly be reassured by the turbulence that swept over Europe in the 1930s against the backdrop of the Great Depression. In Germany, Hitler�s Nazi Party came to power in 1933, reorganized the economy along authoritarian lines, and launched a massive remilitarization. In Italy, Mussolini, in power since 1922, consolidated his Fascist dictatorship and invaded Ethiopia. In the Soviet Union, a totalitarian Communist regime pursued its ruthless program of nationalization, collectivism, and central economic planning. In Spain, Franco crushed the Republicans in a three-year civil war and imposed his four-and-a-half-decade dictatorship. And in France, the Third Republic, the parliamentary regime that had followed the fall of Napoleon III in 1871, teetered on the verge of collapse.<br><br> President Paul Doumer was assassinated by a pro-Fascist Russian in 1932. Two years later, on February 6, 1934, violent clashes between police and far-right rioters on the Place de la Concorde left some 30 dead and 2,000 wounded. In a country rocked by strikes, militant syndicalism, unemployment, and political instability-the revolving-door governments of the Third Republic lasted an average of six months-the leftist Front populaire under Socialist L on Blum won a parliamentary majority in 1936 and proceeded to carry out a number of sweeping reforms. Among them: the five-day workweek, graduated wage hikes, nationalization of the...</p><h2>The Water Hole</h2><p>In the tradition of his best-selling alphabet book, Animalia, author and illustrator Graeme Base takes young readers on an exhilarating journey of discovery with an ingenious fusion of counting book, puzzle book, storybook, and art book. From the plains of Africa and the jungles of the Amazon to the woodlands of North America and the deserts of outback Australia, the animals come together to drink from the water hole. But their water supply is diminishing. What&#39;s going on? Each sumptuous landscape illustration conceals hidden animal pictures for readers to find as they count the animals that visit the water hole and try to solve the mystery: will the animals come back or is their water source gone forever?</p><p>Who can resist the allure of the hidden wilderness water hole? Certainly not one rhino. Not two tigers. Nor three toucans. Pretty soon the delicious pool is drawing moose, catfish, pandas, tortoises... and more than 100 other critters from Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and beyond. But is it our imagination or is that rhino-sized water hole dwindling to a mere shadow of its former self, a puddle not fit for eight ladybugs, let alone 10 kangaroos? As the seasons change across the world, and the animals get thirstier, the water supply diminishes. Eventually, even the flowery-shirted frog that has stoically lingered through the drought packs his suitcase and takes off. The only hope now is a drop of rain on the parched earth...<p> With his usual elaborate detail, Graeme Base, mad genius behind <i>Animalia</i>, <i>The Eleventh Hour: A Curious Mystery</i>, and other wild and wonderful titles, presents a one-of-a-kind counting book. Naturally, Base would never be content to stick with a simple 1 through 10 format. Readers of all ages will linger over each spread, first counting the highlighted animals and giggling at the translation of their grunts and growls (the moose's "Moo, moo, mooooooiii!" means "Hey, get your hoof out of my ear!"). Then it's time to check out the diminishing size of the die-cut hole in the pond. And finally, readers will want to find each of the 10 additional animals cleverly hidden in every illustration, based on the silhouetted creatures in the border. A safari on paper--with an environmental and mathematical education thrown in for good measure. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>From the bestselling author of <b>Animalia</b>, comes an ingenious fusion of counting book, puzzle, story book, and art book. <br> <br>Graeme Base takes us on an exhilarating journey of discovery from the plains of Africa and the jungles of the Amazon to the woodlands of North America and the deserts of Australia. At first glance, this is a simple 1 to 10 counting book featuring familiar animals as they gather at a water hole deep in the forest: One Rhino, Two Tigers, Three Toucans ? <br> <br>But page by page the numbers increase as animals from different continents come to the water hole to drink. At the same time the water hole itself is shrinking until eventually it is nothing but cracked, dry mud. If the water hole symbolizes world resources, then its depletion has universal overtones. <br> <br>When will the rains come? Finally a single droplet splashes down on the parched soil.

The projects are showcased in easy to follow and photogenic project layouts, guiding both the novice and the more experienced crafter in a highly achievable way. Included with every project are thoughtful lifestyle tips showing how macram� can provide the perfect finishing touch for the modern, well-designed home--whether it's a hundred-year-old farmhouse, a sophisticated loft, or a cozy but stylish rental.</p><p>EMILY KATZ is a creative consultant, interior designer, macram� teacher, artist, and Instagram phenomenon. She has taught macram� to thousands of people around the globe, and created custom installations and&nbsp;projects for Microsoft, Ralph Lauren, and more. Emily has been featured in the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>London Daily Mail, Buzzfeed, Nylon</i>,&nbsp;<i>Popeye</i>&nbsp;magazine, and&nbsp;<i>Elle Japan</i>,&nbsp;<i>Elle NL</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Elle France</i>&nbsp;to name a few.INTRODUCTION<br>I learned macram� from my mom.<br><br>At sixteen, my mom made macram� plant hangers by hand-knotting cords of brown jute. She sold her creations at a hair salon, frequented by her mother, so that she could buy her first Martin guitar. The fashion trend then was all about hand-knotted beaded belts and ponchos&#x2014;anything that swung when you wore it. While sifting through photo albums, I discovered that her childhood home was full of macram�. Plants hung in the windows suspended from beaded macram� plant hangers, and knotted owls watched over the family from the wood-paneled walls of the den.&nbsp; <br><br>My parents split up when I was nine years old,and my mom moved across the country. We didn&#x2019;t have much of a relationship while I was growing up; but after turning thirty, I felt like it was time to reconnect. So in 2013, when my boyfriend suggested we visit her while ona trip to the East Coast, I agreed with some trepidation. I didn&#x2019;t know what I would sayto her. Would we get along? We barely knew each other. But I did know the story about my mom making macram�. <br><br>My home in Portland has plants on nearly every surface&#x2014;more than a hundred of them. Before the trip to see my mom, I had collected a few vintage macram� plant hangers to display my plants in, but I wanted to learn how to make my own. If my mom could teach me how to macram�, my hope was that we could connect over a common interest. <br><br>Before settling into my mother&#x2019;s cozy Connecticut home, we gathered the materials we needed for our afternoon project: cotton cord, a metal ring, and some old beads scavenged from her craft drawer. We stood in her kitchen making plant hangers while my half-sisters baked vegan cookies and my boyfriend sat on the floor serenading us with my mom&#x2019;s Martin guitar&#x2014;the same one that she&#x2019;d bought so many years ago with her earnings from making macram�. <br><br>It was a sweet and beautiful moment, one that is forever etched into my memory. After the trip, my boyfriend and I hung the plant hangers in our guest bathroom, and I mostly forgot about macram�. I made a few pieces as gifts for friends, but besides that, I was busy doing other things. During that period, I was working as an art director for a local company and didn&#x2019;t make a lot of time for crafting.<br><br>That fall, a Japanese magazine called <i>Liniere </i>was in Portland doing a feature on DIY interiors and design. They had discovered our home through my Instagram account and wanted to feature us. Their team wandered around our house, snapping photos and asking through a translator about special details wehad created in our space. How did you make the countertops? What inspired the hand-screen-printed toe kicks for the stairs? Why do you have a mirror over your stove? One woman, Kanae Ishii, renowned for her <i>Love Customizer</i> craft and DIY books in Japan, asked me where the macram� plant hangers that hung in our bathroom came from.<br><br>I began to tell her the story of reconnecting with my mom and how meaningful it was. She listened to the translator and then asked,&#x201c;But where do we get them?&#x201d;<br><br>At this time, macram� had only recently resurfaced and wasn&#x2019;t as readily available as it is now. I didn&#x2019;t know where to send them to find it, so I suggested they check out the flea market or local thrift shops in hopes of finding some fun vintage pieces. After they left, I thought, &#x201c;What if I taught them myself?&#x201d; and called to see if they had anytime to come back and learn how to make a macram� plant hanger. Early the next day they arrived back at my home, and I taught my very first macram� workshop to Japanese magazine editors in my living room.<br><br>Since then, I&#x2019;ve gone on to macram� area rugs, ceiling installations, daybeds, headboards, tents, and wedding backdrops. I even fashioned a skeleton costume for Halloween out of macram�. I have taught macram� workshops in Los Angeles, NewYork, London, Copenhagen, and throughout Japan. I&#x2019;ve grown to appreciate the fact that macram�&#x2019;s threads run deep through history, from Bedouin caravans to European courts, and from turn-of-the-century sailors&#x2019; hammocks to fine Victorian handicrafts. ButI am especially delighted to contribute to its modern renaissance, and am grateful that this medium has inspired a reconnection with my mother that I hadn&#x2019;t imagined possible.<br><br>Nowadays, you can find modern macram� everywhere. It&#x2019;s the creatively homespun bag on the shoulder of that boho-chic model or your stylish best friend. It holds the plant hanging in the background of that Instagram shot, the fiber art on the wall of a cutting-edge art gallery or boutique hotel. It&#x2019;s also the textured headboard, the elegant hanging lamp, and the gorgeous patio garlands in this book.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a reason macram� has resurfaced. More and more of us are seeking a bit of warmth, craft, and adornment in the midst of modern life. And macram�&#x2014;in its clean-yet-dreamy, updated incarnation&#x2014;is a perfect point of entry into creating a unique, one-of-a-kind, handmade lifestyle, one that is literally at your fingertips. If you have ever wanted to learn macram� but didn&#x2019;t know where to begin, or even if you are a seasoned knot tier, this book will provide both inspiration and detailed instruction to help guide you on your journey&nbsp; of this beautiful craft.</p><h2>The Haunting of Sunshine Girl: Book One (The Haunting of Sunshine Girl Series, 1)</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller</b><b><i>The Haunting of Sunshine Girl</i>,in active development for television by The Weinstein Company, a hit paranomal YA series based on the wildly popular YouTube channel about an "adorkable" teenager living in a haunted house.</b><br><br> Shortly after her sixteenth birthday, Sunshine Griffith and her mother Kat move from sunny Austin, Texas, to the rain-drenched town of Ridgemont, Washington.

Along the way, the concept of the superhero is dissected as an unknown assassin stalks the erstwhile heroes.</p><p>Has any comic been as acclaimed as Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' <i>Watchmen</i>? Possibly only Frank Miller's <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>, but <i>Watchmen</i> remains the critics' favorite. Why? Because Moore is a better writer, and <i>Watchmen</i> a more complex and dark and literate creation than Miller's fantastic, subversive take on the Batman myth. Moore, renowned for many other of the genre's finest creations (<i>Saga of the Swamp Thing</i>, <i>V for Vendetta</i>, and <i>From Hell</i>, with Eddie Campbell) first put out <i>Watchmen</i> in 12 issues for DC in 1986-87. It won a comic award at the time (the 1987 Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards for Best Writer/Artist combination) and has continued to gather praise since.<p> The story concerns a group called the Crimebusters and a plot to kill and discredit them. Moore's characterization is as sophisticated as any novel's. Importantly the costumes do not get in the way of the storytelling; rather they allow Moore to investigate issues of power and control--indeed it was <i>Watchmen</i>, and to a lesser extent <i>Dark Knight</i>, that propelled the comic genre forward, making "adult" comics a reality. The artwork of Gibbons (best known for 2000AD's <i>Rogue Trooper</i> and DC's Green Lantern) is very fine too, echoing Moore's paranoid mood perfectly throughout. Packed with symbolism, some of the overlying themes (arms control, nuclear threat, vigilantes) have dated but the intelligent social and political commentary, the structure of the story itself, its intertextuality (chapters appended with excerpts from other "works" and "studies" on Moore's characters, or with excerpts from another comic book being read by a child within the story), the finepace of the writing and its humanity mean that <i>Watchmen</i> more than stands up--it keeps its crown as the best the genre has yet produced. <i>--Mark Thwaite</i> <br> <br> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Dave Gibbons on the Making of <i>Watchmen</i></strong> <br> </p><p> </p><p><b>Question:</b> You were tasked with drawing new illustrations of key shots from the new <i>Watchmen</i> film. Was it a difficult challenge to re-imagine your work in this movie format?</p> <p><b>Dave Gibbons:</b> I don&#x2019;t think that I actually did many key shots from the film. I had to actually imagine them rather than exactly recreate what was going to be in the movie. But as far as the drawings I did for the licensing purposes, accuracy was the real key so that they looked exactly like the movie. Whereas doing the graphic novel was creating stuff afresh and being very creative, this was more the case of interpreting something that already existed. So it was rather more a commercial art job than a creative thing.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How many scenes from the original graphic novel did you redraw in the new "movie" format?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> I kind of did them piecemeal, these licensing drawings. I did do a section of storyboarding for Zack Snyder. There is a part of the movie that isn&#x2019;t in the graphic novel and he wanted to see how I would have drawn it, if it had been in the graphic novel. So I redid the storyboards as three pages of comic on the nine-panel grid, also getting it coloured by John Higgins so it looked authentic. But I think there were probably only 3 or 4 scenes that I drew, which were from the movie.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was your working method for producing these new illustrations from the film? And how has it changed from when you originally illustrated <i>Watchmen</i>?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> When you&#x2019;re producing things from existing material, you have to look at and assemble the references... you know, keep looking backwards and forwards to make sure what you&#x2019;re drawing is accurate to what&#x2019;s in the photos. I did have lots of photos from the movie and in some cases I had more or less the illustration I was going to do in photo form, which made it a lot easier. On others I had to construct it from various references: really just the usual illustrator&#x2019;s job of drawing something to reference. And on the original illustrations of <i>Watchmen</i>, I was free to come up with exactly the angles and exactly the costumes and everything that I wanted to. When you&#x2019;ve designed a costume and drawn it a few times, you actually internalize it and you find you can draw it without having to refer to reference at all. So in some ways it&#x2019;s more creative and in some ways it&#x2019;s easier!</p> <p><b>Q:</b> In <i>Watchmen: The Art of the Film</i>, there are concept designs by other artists of their visions of your iconic characters. What do you think of their versions and did you offer any guidance while they were working on these?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> It&#x2019;s always really interesting to see versions of your characters drawn by other artists. You tend to see things in them that you hadn&#x2019;t noticed before. So I really enjoyed looking at those. I certainly didn&#x2019;t offer them any guidance. The purpose of getting those kinds of drawings done is to get a fresh perspective on what exists. I noticed actually that they really stuck more closely to my original designs than those, but I really enjoyed seeing them.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Watchmen: Portraits</i> is Clay Enos&#x2019;s stunning black and white collection of photos of each character from the <i>Watchmen</i> movie. What was it like looking through this book at all the characters you had conceived years ago now being brought to life by actors?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> It&#x2019;s rather interesting; you know if you look at the <i>Watching the Watchmen</i> book you can see these characters as fairly sketchy rough conceptual versions. Then when you look at Clay&#x2019;s book you can actually see them right down to counting the number of pores on the skin on the end of their noses! It&#x2019;s incredible high focus! It&#x2019;s like zooming in through space and time to look at the surface of some moon of Saturn or something. I thoroughly enjoyed his book... it had a real artistic quality to it that was really so good. And of course to see these actors who so much are the embodiment of what I drew, that it&#x2019;s a tremendous thrill to see them made flesh!</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Watchmen: The Film Companion</i> features some stills from the animated version of <i>The Black Freighter</i>. What do you think of the look and design of this animated feature? </p> <p><b>DG:</b> It looks really interesting! Although I drew my version in the comic book in a kind of horror-comic style, these are very much in a savage manga style. I think they work really well... they&#x2019;ve got the kind of manic intensity, which I think that work should have and I really can&#x2019;t wait to see the whole feature. I&#x2019;ve seen the trailer for it and that looks great and again they&#x2019;ve used a lot of the compositions that I came up with but just translated them to this kind of very modern drawn animation.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How much time did you spend on the set of <i>Watchmen</i>? Was it a surreal experience to see your work recreated like this?</p> <p><b>DG:</b> I was on the set of <i>Watchmen</i> for a couple of days and it really was surreal to walk through a door and then suddenly be in the presence of all these people in living breathing flesh! I was there for what you would call the Crimebusters meeting where they were all there in costume in the same room, which was incredible. They had obviously planned that so I would get to see everyone. It was surreal though quite a wonderful experience to see it come to life.</p><b>Alan Moore</b> is perhaps the most acclaimed writer in the graphic story medium, having garnered countless awards for works such as <i>Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Swamp Thing</i> and <i>Miracleman</i>.

He has received numerous prizes and awards, most notably the Wolf Foundation Prize in physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking,&nbsp;and The Royal Society's Copley Medal. He is the author of three previous books, including <i>The Emperor&#x2019;s New Mind</i>. He lives in Oxford, England.<b>PREFACE</b><br><br>One of the deepest mysteries of our universe is the puzzle of whence it came.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I entered Cambridge University as a mathematics graduate student, in the early 1950s, a fascinating cosmological theory was in the ascendant, known as the steady-state model. According to this scheme, the universe had no beginning, and it remained more-or-less the same, overall, for all time. The steady-state universe was able to achieve this, despite its expansion, because the continual depletion of material arising from the universe&#x2019;s expansion is taken to be compensated by the continual creation of new material, in the form of an extremely diffuse hydrogen gas. My friend and mentor at Cambridge, the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, from whom I learnt the thrill of so much new physics, was at that time a strong proponent of steady-state cosmology, and he impressed upon me the beauty and power of that remarkable scheme of things.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet this theory has not stood the test of time. About 10 years after I had first entered Cambridge, and had become well acquainted with the theory, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered, to their own surprise, an all-pervading electromagnetic radiation, coming in from all directions, now referred to as the cosmic microwave background or CMB. This was soon identified, by Robert Dicke, as a predicted implication of the &#x2018;flash&#x2019; of a Big-Bang origin to the universe, now presumed to have taken place some 14 thousand million years ago&#x2014;an event that had been first seriously envisaged by Monsignor Georges Lema�tre in 1927, as an implication of his work on Einstein&#x2019;s 1915 equations of general relativity and early observational indications of an expansion of the universe. With great courage and scientific honesty (when the CMB data became better established), Dennis Sciama publicly repudiated his earlier views and strongly supported the idea of the Big Bang origin to the universe from then on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since that time, cosmology has matured from a speculative pursuit into an exact science, and intense analysis of the CMB&#x2014;coming from highly detailed data, generated by numerous superb experiments&#x2014;has formed a major part of this revolution. However, many mysteries remain, and much speculation continues to be part of this endeavour. In this book, I provide descriptions not only of the main models of classical relativistic cosmology but also of various developments and puzzling issues that have arisen since then. Most particularly, there is a profound oddness underlying the Second Law of thermodynamics and the very nature of the Big Bang. In relation to this, I am putting forward a body of speculation of my own, which brings together many strands of different aspects of the universe we know.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own unorthodox approach dates from the summer of 2005, though much of the detail is more recent. This account goes seriously into some of the geometry, but I have refrained from including, in the main body of the text, anything serious in the way of equations or other technicalities, all these being banished to the Appendices. The experts, only, are referred to those parts of the book. The scheme that I am now arguing for here is indeed unorthodox, yet it is based on geometrical and physical ideas which are very soundly based. Although something entirely different, this proposal turns out to have strong echoes of the old steady-state model!<br> &nbsp;<br> I wonder what Dennis Sciama would have made of it.</p><h2>Prayers of Honoring Voice</h2><p>The throat, located just one energy center north of the heart and one jump south of the mind, is in a precarious position in the body. Play with me for a moment: if you were to consider the mind a machine, say, a telegraph in service to the heart, then the heart gives the first dictation. The mind then translates vital information in the form of language to the speaker system of voice, which will hopefully transmit the communications as the heart intended, if that is the priority. It is a good time to ask yourself what your priorities of communication are. What is motivating you?A short journey from heart to mind and back down to the throat takes mere seconds, but a mighty many detours are taken en route. This may be because the fear residing in the mind is like a highwayman, waylaying our genuine matters of the heart and causing havoc as it tries to make its simple way out of the human body. There are other desperados who lure the vulnerable traveler off-path: insecurity, anxiety, self-consciousness, the fragile ego&#x2014;but nearly all are unmasked first cousins to fear when flushed out of the shadows. Some fears are linked to primal traumas which may yet be unearthed. These deserve special attention when working with voice.I think the greatest of all distractions between heart and throat might be faithlessness, because reigning religious institutions have effectively redirected the focus from faith to matters of righteousness, wrongness and &#x201c;policies&#x201d;. Faith in love, and what it can do, has taken a particularly destructive back seat to the priorities of massive organizations with other things in mind than loving kindness, peaceful communication, fair resolutions, wellness and the expressive voices of living, breathing people.For today&#x2019;s spiritually traumatized, broken-hearted and soul-wounded, the process of revealing what rests on the heart can be a paralyzing challenge. To clear the path of negative imprint, one must declare the intention to speak to what matters most and set about the task of discerning what that is. One can make a choice now to stand up to the fears that mangle the truth into expressions more palatable for others, cause explosions of rage, freezing up, or cut-and-run behavior.To love the truth more than anything else is a tall order.</p><p>Pixie Lighthorse is the creator of nearly forty online programs working with specific animal totems to heal the soul&#39;s early wounds, offer witnessing in community and move participants into active self-healing practices following rhythms of the seasons.

Eleven-year-old Phillip was blinded by flying debris when a torpedo struck the SS <i>Hato, </i>and old Timothy has taught&nbsp;him how to survive.

His books include the bestseller <i>The Cay, Timothy of the Cay, The Bomb, Air Raid--Pearl Harbor!, Ice Drift, The Maldonado Miracle, </i>and <i>The Weirdo,</i> an Edgar Award winner for Best Young Adult Mystery.</p>Grade 5-8-Twenty-four years after publication of The Cay (Doubleday, 1987, 1969), Taylor returns to his story of a young white boy stranded on a Caribbean island with an elderly, resourceful black man. The narrative alternates between Phillip's first-person accounts of what happened to him after his rescue, and flashbacks in the third person telling Timothy's story, starting with his childhood in St. Thomas. In The Cay, readers learned how Phillip came to be on the torpedoed ship Hato; this prequel/sequel adds depth to Timothy's character through its treatment of episodes that led up to that event. The boy's story is less revealing than the man's, and some of it has already been told and is slightly contradicted by dates in the final chapter of The Cay. Faithful in tone, dialect, and characterization to the earlier title, Timothy does not delve as deeply into the theme of the first book. Instead, while it touches on racial prejudice, its focus is more on Phillip's appreciation of his friend and guardian angel, and on the adventurous and touching yarns of the West Indian man's life at sea. Those who enjoyed the earlier book will feel as though they're meeting up with old acquaintances and learning more about them, and will see the story come full circle when Phillip returns-with his sight-to the island.<br><i>Susan Knorr, Milwaukee Public Library, WI</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thea Stilton and the Cherry Blossom Adventure (Thea Stilton #6): A Geronimo Stilton Adventure</h2><p>Geronimo's adventurous sister Thea is taking the publishing world by storm in this fabumouse tale packed with action, mystery, and friendship.<br><br>In this exciting adventure, the Thea Sisters are off to Japan on a cultural exchange program.

This enchanting account of life as the daughter of one of Hollywood&#x2019;s sexiest icons will leave you entertained, delighted, and nostalgic for a time gone by.</p><p>I loved being called Deana Martin. Even when I was very small. Dad was such a positive influence on people's lives that to be so closely associated with him was always a blessing. People can't help but smile when they think of my father, which has to be the greatest legacy of all. When people hear my name for the first time, they usually ask the same question: "Any relation?" "Yes," I reply proudly, "he's my father." They smile and cry, "Oh, I love your father! I've loved him all my life." Sometimes, just sometimes, they ask me the most important question of all: "Was he a good father?" To their surprise, I shake my head and smile. "No," I reply. "He wasn't a good father, but he was a good man." Where Dad came from, that meant a great deal more. <p>So begins Deana Martin's captivating and heartfelt memoir of her father, the son of an Italian immigrant from modest beginnings who worked his way to the top of the Hollywood firmament to become one of the greatest stars of all time. <br>Charming, debonair, and impeccably attired in a black tuxedo, Dean Martin was coolness incarnate. His music provided the soundtrack of romance, and his image captivated movie and television audiences for more than fifty years. His daughter Deana was among his most devoted fans, but she also knew a side of him that few others ever glimpsed. <br>In page-turning prose, Deana recalls her early childhood, when she and her siblings were left in the erratic care of Dean's loving but alcoholic first wife. She chronicles the constantly changing blended family that marked her youth, along with the unexpected moments of silliness and tenderness that this unusual Hollywood family shared. Deana candidly reveals the impactof Dean's fame and characteristic aloofness on her efforts to forge her own identity, but delights in sharing wonderful, never-before-told stories about her father and his pallies known as the Rat Pack. It may not have been a normal childhood, but Deana's enchanting account of life as the daughter of one of Hollywood's sexiest icons will leave you entertained, delighted, and nostalgic for a time gone by. <br>"From her heart, Deana Martin has told a frank and honest account of what her life was like with her famous father and family. It has been a wild ride, with lots of ups and downs, written with honesty, love, and understanding." --Regis Philbin <br>"Dean Martin was the unique star who attained success in all of the entertainment media--movies, TV, recordings, concerts, and radio. His daughter Deana gives us something else that is also unique in this revealing book about growing up as the daughter of a true legend. Here's to you Dean. I've got the booze, you get the ice." --Don Rickles <br>"I have to say I loved reading what Deana wrote--maybe because she bit the bullet, she was courageous, up-front, tenacious, and so totally forthright. I read it with tremendous pride and love, and I know other readers will feel the same emotions I felt. I love this author for a myriad of reasons, but especially for how she has honored my partner."--from the Foreword by Jerry Lewis </p><p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>Deana Martin is an influential American singer, actor, author and the very proud daughter of iconic entertainer, Dean Martin.

It shows a burly man with a crew cut, sitting in a living room in the 1960s. He&#x2019;s got a cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other. I wonder if he hadn&#x2019;t smoked so many cigarettes maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. He&#x2019;s looking at the camera with a confident grin that says this is not a man to mess with. The only other place I&#x2019;ve ever seen Asian men with kick-butt expressions like that is in samurai or martial-arts movies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that I watch them all that much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, it&#x2019;s bad enough other people make assumptions about us Asian kids. No need for me to help out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I gotta say, that photo can&#x2019;t be further from the old man lying in this bed. The grossest thing is the tube going right up into his nose. It looks horrible, and is attached to a machine that does who knows what.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I go and stand awkwardly by the window, unsure of what to do. I wish Mom had come in with me, but she said Great-Uncle Ted wants to see me alone. Dying man&#x2019;s last wish and all, I guess. I clear my throat and sort of whisper, &#x201c;Um, hi?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Arwhk.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two veiny sacs of his eyelids slowly open, and when he sees me, he gestures, beckoning me over with one hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I gingerly approach the chair next to his bed, careful not to disturb any of the wires and tubes snaking around him. It&#x2019;s hard--I have visions of knocking into some hose or other just as I&#x2019;m supposed to be having a nice visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Gghhh . . .&#x201d; Great-Uncle Ted catches my eye and reaches out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without thinking, I flinch. I have a flashback to a movie I saw where a guy laid out like this had a monster burst out of his chest and jump on someone&#x2019;s face. I&#x2019;m not saying I expect that to happen here, but hey, it does go through my mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted&#x2019;s eyes change. He points impatiently to something on the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A pad and paper. There is spidery writing on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to . . . give you the pad?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now there&#x2019;s a flash of fire in Great-Uncle Ted&#x2019;s eyes. I know when someone&#x2019;s ticked off. The message is clearly Yes, you idiot. Give me the pad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hand the pad to my great-uncle, who winces in pain as he presses a button on the side of his bed that raises him to a seated position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Slowly, he writes something and then hands me the pad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hurts too much to talk. You Amanda&#x2019;s boy, Ted?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I start to write an answer on the pad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next thing I know, Great-Uncle Ted yanks the pad out of my hands.

That can&#x2019;t be good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He scribbles something and hands the pad back to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not deaf, you little dope.

I&#x2019;m Ted.&#x201d; I feel a little weird introducing myself, since he knows who I am, but since I don&#x2019;t remember him, it feels like the right thing to do. And I&#x2019;m pretty sure he seems like a &#x201c;sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old man writes some more. He&#x2019;s writing with more energy now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You got big. Do you still like playing games?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What games do you mean, sir?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kissing games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What th--?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, no, sir,&#x201d; I begin. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t enjoy kissing games. That is, I&#x2019;ve never played them. Maybe I would enjoy them if I did. I mean, you never know about something until you try it, right?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m babbling now. Trying to look casual, I lean against something, then realize it&#x2019;s a pole holding some fluid going into my great-uncle (or maybe coming out of him--hard to tell). Gross. I attempt to cross my legs, but I dare anyone to try to do it while wearing these ICU snot-green-colored clown pants they made me wear over my jeans to come in here. It&#x2019;s not so simple. So my leg sort of hovers half hoisted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Great-Uncle Ted is scribbling away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know you like computer games, you little twerp. I just wanted to see your face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laugh, and I see a hint of a smile under all the machinery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You like the ones where you shoot people?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not allowed to play those,&#x201d; I say, which is the truth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t ask if you were allowed to. I asked if you liked them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I smile and nod. This guy is pretty sharp. &#x201c;Um . . . yeah, I play them sometimes.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted looks at me with an expression I can&#x2019;t make out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of fun, huh?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess.&#x201d; I shrug.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that&#x2019;s the only way you ever have to shoot and kill a man. The other way is a lot less fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve killed a man?&#x201d; I try to ask casually, but it kind of comes out in a squeak. Not my most macho moment, but give me a break, I wasn&#x2019;t ready for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quite a few, yes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What did Uncle Ted do before he retired? I wonder what sort of professions call for killing men. Or more precisely, &#x201c;quite a few&#x201d; men. Was he a soldier? A hit man?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let&#x2019;s talk about something else. Why do you like these games so much?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m happy to move on. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the shooting games are all that--and that&#x2019;s the truth. It&#x2019;s more something to do with my friends when we hang out.

Not just the door. There&#x2019;s that window. You could tie your sheets together and climb down there, or maybe there&#x2019;s an air-conditioning duct--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TAP TAP TAP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My brilliant analysis is interrupted by the sound of my great-uncle&#x2019;s pencil tapping loudly on the pad to get my attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was actually referring to dying, Ted. Try to keep up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sit down, deflated. &#x201c;I guess I didn&#x2019;t think of that,&#x201d; I say honestly, &#x201c;because you seem so alive.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted does his best to roll his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t bother sucking up to a dying man, Ted. You any good at these room games?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Never seen a game I couldn&#x2019;t solve or beat. I&#x2019;m always the top scorer--that means I&#x2019;ve solved them quicker than anyone else. I guess that makes me the best,&#x201d; I say, before realizing how obnoxious it sounds. &#x201c;That sounds like bragging. Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You ever heard of Dizzy Dean?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, that&#x2019;s a little random. But old people do that sometimes. The name does sound kind of familiar, but I can&#x2019;t place it.

He&#x2019;s clearly tired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stare out the window, watching the headlights of the traffic below making patterns on the ceiling. &#x201c;Yeah. That&#x2019;s about the one thing I am good at,&#x201d; I say softly, almost to myself. I hear scratching, and he&#x2019;s up and writing more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t ever sell yourself short, Ted.

Lila&#x2019;s the smart one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lila is my big sister, the bane of my existence. Lila the straight-A student, Lila the president of the student body. Lila, who got the highest Board scores in La Purisma High&#x2019;s history. Lila, who gave the most beautifully written senior address at her graduation, currently crushing it in her freshman year at Harvard. I mean, seriously. Why even try to compete with that?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your mother told me you&#x2019;re smarter than your sister. You just don&#x2019;t know it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, snap! I hope there&#x2019;s a burn unit at Harvard, because Lila just got smoked. Big-time!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m starting to like Great-Uncle Ted. But I feel bad. We&#x2019;ve been talking about me the whole time I&#x2019;ve been here. Well, except for the part about him killing a lot of people. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I don&#x2019;t want to hear more about that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So I guess you knew my mom when she was a little kid,&#x201d; I begin. &#x201c;What was she like?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda was a pain in the a</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stops and his eye drifts up to my face and back down to his pad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda was a pain in the a behind, if you&#x2019;ll excuse my French.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t believe I thought this was going to be boring. This is great! &#x201c;Seriously? How so?&#x201d; It takes all the self-control I can muster to get this out without cracking up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He writes for a long time, then hands the pad to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When she was nine, she had this thing where no matter what you would ask her she&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s for me to know and you to find out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like you&#x2019;d ask her, &#x201c;What flavor ice cream do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for me to know and you to find out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What movie do you want to see?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for me to know and you to find out!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do I have lung cancer?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for me to know and you to find out!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I choke at that last one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted waves his hand wearily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I made that last one up. But she did say it all the time. She thought it was cute. It stopped being cute after the first day. Then it was annoying as heck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted pauses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she was always smart. And I&#x2019;m very proud of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted was the one who paid for Mom to come to California from Hawaii and go to nursing school. She&#x2019;s been working here at La Purisma General Hospital for as long as I can remember.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted looks up from the paper, and his wise, half-lidded eyes meet mine. He scrawls on the page and holds up the pad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please tell me about the games you play. How you solve these puzzles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wait. Is a real, live adult person actually asking me details about the games I play? This is unheard of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I go on and on, explaining how the games work, how at first nothing seems to make sense. But then, as I put my mind to it, a little click goes off in my head and the pieces begin to fit. It&#x2019;s an awesome feeling when it all comes together and you get it right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted seems genuinely interested, especially when I tell him about a particularly tricky puzzle, where if you look carefully at what appears to be a bunch of random drinking glasses on a tray, you realize they actually resemble the hands of a clock set to a particular time. Which is one of the main clues to solving that game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You know, maybe if they let me, I can come back tomorrow with my laptop and show you some,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m saying, when I see that his head has fallen back onto the bed and his eyes are closed. &#x201c;Great-Uncle Ted! Are you all right?&#x201d; I gasp. &#x201c;Should I get Mom?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wearily reaches for the pad and writes carefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m just tired. But I&#x2019;m happy to see you again, Ted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I--I&#x2019;m so glad I could talk to you too, sir,&#x201d; I say, feeling my breathing slow down again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel so much better about everything now. You are ready.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Huh? What does that mean?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old man looks up at me. The energy is clearly draining out of him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You must promise me one thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, sir. I promise I&#x2019;ll work harder in school, and I&#x2019;ll never tell Mom you thought she was a pain in the behind--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think he&#x2019;ll laugh at this, but instead, he gathers his strength and writes furiously across the pad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No! Listen to me! You must promise me</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&#x2019;s writing slower now, forcing the words out of the pen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great-Uncle Ted falls back and throws the pad at me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE BOX IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. KEEP LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS. ALWAYS GO FOR BROKE! PROMISE ME!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With great effort, he tugs on my sleeve. I lean toward him. He pulls me down until my ear is close to his face. I can just make out the word he is saying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Promise!&#x201d; the old man croaks. He releases my sleeve. He looks peaceful now, like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As my great-uncle falls asleep, I hear my own voice, sounding far away, whispering, &#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s All in the Game</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, for someone who didn&#x2019;t want to see his great-uncle again, you certainly spent enough time in there,&#x201d; my mom says as we&#x2019;re driving home from the hospital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I backed quietly out of his room, my mom was having a whispered conversation with the two ICU nurses on duty. She looked worried.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I start to answer her, when a car cuts her off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Darn it,&#x201d; she mutters.

He wanted to name the dog "Put Your Shirt On" (please don't ask why), but he was outvoted by his family. The dog's name is Shadow. Early in his career Tom worked in politics, including a stint as the chief speechwriter for the governor of Ohio. This experience helped him develop the unique, storytelling narrative style of the Stick Dog books. More important, Tom's time in politics made him realize a very important thing: Kids are way smarter than adults. And it's a lot more fun and rewarding to write stories for them than to write speeches for grown-ups.</p></p><h2>The Quick Study for Medical Terminolgy (Quickstudy Books)</h2><p><p>The new QuickStudy Booklets cover the key information on some of the toughest courses today, helping students boost their grades.

She lives on Nantucket.1<br><br>Courtney always took the slow ferry to Nantucket at the beginning of the summer. It was a sort of ritual for her, watching Hyannis with its docks, wharves, beach houses, and sailboats slide slowly into the background until the ship was surrounded by water, with no land in sight. It was the gentle disconnecting from the mainland that made it possible for her to let go of the real world and everything it contained. For two hours, she would sit at a window, staring out at the infinite blue sea, its white-�tipped waves, its oddly serene seabirds bobbing blithely so far from land, and in the distance, like a child&#x2019;s first drawing, a fishing trawler sputtering along with its nets sinking down and down into the mysterious watery unknown. Suddenly, Courtney would catch a glimmer along the horizon. Low and flat, it shimmered like a mirage, and as the steamship Nantucket rumbled along, an intense point of light would flash and disappear, flash and disappear&#x2014;�the first sign of Nantucket, the Great Point Light. As soon as she spotted this, Courtney would rise from her seat, walk down the aisle and push her way out through the heavy door to the bow. Here the wind whipped her hair into her face and the sun shone into her eyes and the air smelled of salt. She was almost there, and she wanted to be alert and watchful, to feel herself being borne closer and closer to the island she loved.<br><br>She was standing on the deck now, scanning the horizon for landmarks&#x2014;�the water tower, the cluster of rainbow sailboats daringly leaving the harbor, the buoys.<br><br>This year, this summer&#x2014;�this would be a time she would always remember. She was sure of that.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you been to the island before?&#x201d;<br><br>An older woman had come to join her, and stood next to her, her age-�marked hands holding tight to the railing.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, several times, actually, for about ten years,&#x201d; Courtney replied. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br><br>The deeply tanned creases of the woman&#x2019;s face readjusted themselves as she smiled. &#x201c;Growing up, my family summered here. My parents left me their house, and my husband and children and I summered here. This summer our grandchildren are visiting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How lucky you are,&#x201d; Courtney said wistfully. She wanted what this woman had, she wanted to marry the man she loved and raise a great pack of children on the island.<br><br>The woman studied Courtney. &#x201c;And where do you stay when you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br><br>Courtney paused before admitting, &#x201c;With the Vickereys on the cliff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Vickereys!&#x201d; The woman stood back a pace, the better to scan Courtney up and down, appraising her. &#x201c;Are you a Vickerey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; Courtney hurriedly assured her. &#x201c;I went to school with Robin Vickerey. We were roommates at Smith, became good friends, and I&#x2019;ve just fallen into the habit of visiting a lot.&#x201d; Even as she spoke the words, Courtney could hear the style, the blas� cadence of the Vickerey family: I&#x2019;ve just fallen into the habit&#x202f;. . . As if she were one of the Vickereys and belonged in that enormous rambling house as part of their accomplished, complicated, turbulent, family.<br><br>The older woman arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say you&#x2019;re lucky, too, then. You&#x2019;re one of Susanna Vickerey&#x2019;s summer children.&#x201d;<br><br>Summer children: that was what Susanna called her four children&#x2019;s best friends who spent every summer in the Vickerey home, even though those &#x201c;children&#x201d; were adults and had been for years.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Courtney agreed happily. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br><br>The first summer Courtney Hendricks spent on Nantucket, she was eighteen years old, a na�ve, book-�smart optimist who didn&#x2019;t know what the world would throw at her but was sure she could handle it.<br><br>And after all, look at what had happened: even though she was from little ol&#x2019; Emporia, Kansas, she&#x2019;d been accepted by one of the finest women&#x2019;s colleges, Smith College, in Massachusetts. Even better, best of all, her roommate was Robin Vickerey, who became Courtney&#x2019;s dearest friend.<br><br>Robin had long flaming red hair that curled like party ribbon and green eyes and adorable freckles spattered across her nose. With looks like that, you&#x2019;d think she&#x2019;d be kind of wild, but Robin was cool, calm, and collected, a quiet, studious, organized person who was a gem at stopping quarrels in the dorm. Robin and Courtney had become friends immediately. They shared the same sensibility. They were truly engrossed with their studies. They weren&#x2019;t geeks, but they didn&#x2019;t do quite as many stupid things as the other girls in their dorm. Courtney knew she was considered a goody-�goody, which she probably was. She assumed her Midwestern upbringing was responsible for that, so she was surprised to find the same kind of careful, helpful, Girl Scoutish attitude in Robin. After she came to know the entire Vickerey family, she understood why.<br><br>On a long spring weekend of their freshman year, Robin had invited Courtney to her home on Nantucket. She&#x2019;d mentioned that summer jobs as retail clerks, waitstaff, and landscapers paid outstanding money and Courtney wanted to check it out. Courtney&#x2019;s parents did all right for themselves&#x2014;�her father owned a pharmacy for which her mother did the books. But Courtney wanted to help soften the blow of college tuition and expenses. She&#x2019;d worked after school and on weekends in Emporia&#x2014;�why not work on Nantucket, where the pay was so much better? So she went along with Robin. They caught a ride to the Cape, took the fast ferry to Nantucket, and Susanna Vickerey, Robin&#x2019;s mother, met them at the boat and drove them out to &#x2019;Sconset.<br><br>When Courtney first saw where the Vickereys lived, she was dazzled. Anybody would be. It was a huge old house with lots of bedrooms, set on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Dr. Vickerey was a surgeon in Boston; the Vickereys kept an apartment in the Back Bay, but the family home was Nantucket. They had four children, and their house was always jam-�packed to its literal rafters with friends. The mother, Susanna, liked it that way. She said it filled her soul to have guests around. She called some of the guests her &#x201c;summer children,&#x201d; even after they turned twenty-�one.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay for the summer,&#x201d; Robin had coaxed Courtney. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always room for one more.&#x201d;<br><br>Courtney had gone into town that Saturday afternoon and looked around. The town was sweet and old-�fashioned yet had excellent restaurants with famous chefs and fabulous clothing stores. Lots of places needed summer help. She talked to her parents, her parents talked to Robin&#x2019;s parents, and it was agreed. She went for the first summer and fit right in. She borrowed one of the Vickereys&#x2019; bikes for the ride to work and back. On rainy days, someone was always in the house and willing to drive her into town. On her days off, she went to the beach with Robin. Some nights, when the moon was full and the breeze was inviting, she and Robin wandered down to the beach parties. They drank some, but not much; it didn&#x2019;t interest them. During those years they were just as interested in curling up with a good book on their time off as partying. Or simply staying at home, lounging on the back patio, drinking lemonade, having easy lazy conversations and watching the white curtains flutter as the sea breezes blew through the open windows of the marvelous great house.<br><br>That first summer was eleven years ago. Courtney had come here every summer since then. In many ways, Nantucket felt like her second home. She had graduated from college and come here to work for the summer. She had gone to grad school in Boston for a master&#x2019;s in English literature and come here to work for the summer. She&#x2019;d gotten a job at UMKC teaching English lit and composition, and still, as an adult, for five more summers, she had returned to this island, this house, this family. She told her parents and Kansas friends it was because she made so much money working summers in Nantucket.<br><br>But this year making money wasn&#x2019;t enough of a reason for her to continue to go back East. Thank heavens it was Susanna Vickerey&#x2019;s sixtieth birthday. Courtney had to be there for that. The Vickereys were throwing a huge party, and Susanna had been so wonderful to Courtney for so many years.<br><br>But even the party wasn&#x2019;t the real reason.<br><br>James Vickerey was the real reason.<br><br>Courtney had been in love with him since she first met him eleven years ago. Since everyone in the Vickerey family seemed to know, share, and have opinions&#x2014;�which they discussed openly at the dinner table&#x2014;�about everyone else&#x2019;s secrets, Courtney had kept her feelings fiercely private. Not even Robin knew. Courtney seldom saw James, anyway. She was always working and James was often gone, backpacking in Europe when he was in college, working with a techie start-�up group in Boston after graduation.<br><br>But last year . . . Courtney gripped the ship&#x2019;s railing. After what happened between them last year, she knew she had to return to the island for one more summer.<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t expected Monty Blackhorse to add to her confusion.<br><br>You would think, Courtney thought, that a woman as versed in literature as Courtney would not be surprised by anything that happened between a man and a woman.<br><br>You would think that any woman, no matter what she did, couldn&#x2019;t be shocked by any man if she had grown up with a father, a brother, and a male best friend.<br><br>On the other hand, on the spectrum of men and emotions, Courtney&#x2019;s father and brother were way over on the placid-�headed-�for-�comatose end. They were strong, silent men. Not mysterious. Just silent. Her father was a gruff man&#x2019;s man who came home from his pharmacy expecting dinner on the table and the television tuned to some kind of game&#x2014;�football, baseball, hockey&#x2014;�he&#x2019;d even watch the fishing channel if necessary. Her brother, Donnie, was five years older, a pharmacist working with their father and planning to take over the family business someday. He was obsessed with Legos when they were small, and as Courtney became a lover of books and literature and what Donnie called &#x201c;fussy stuff,&#x201d; what little interest Donnie had in her faded away. Now that he was a father, he&#x2019;d softened a bit, but his children were both boys whose favorite video was of monster trucks in muddy fields.<br><br>And Monty, her best Kansas male friend, had never done anything that shocked her in all the sixteen years since that first day she met him when she was trespassing on his property.<br><br>For her thirteenth birthday&#x2014;�her admittance into adolescence, although she&#x2019;d tried to convince her parents she was an adolescent the moment she hit double digits&#x2014;�her parents had given in and bought her a horse of her own. Star was a buckskin mare with a white star between her eyes. They boarded her at the Schmidts&#x2019; ranch, so until she got her own car at sixteen, she had to bike out there unless she could catch a ride. She could usually pester Donnie into driving her. Her birthday was in early May. That first summer, she had the entire summer stretching before her, day after delicious day of riding.<br><br>The first time she rode Star on the Schmidts&#x2019; land, Courtney entered the stable, Star&#x2019;s new home, and smooth-�talked and gentled the horse as she put on the blanket and saddle. Star stood at seventeen hands. Courtney might have appreciated a stepladder, but she wasn&#x2019;t going to admit it. Awkwardly, she got herself up onto the gracious old roping saddle. It was padded, with wide leather stirrups, a rocking chair of a seat. Courtney had kept Star at a gentle trot as they explored the Schmidts&#x2019; pasture, getting to know the horse, sensing how she and this horse were going to take to each other. She&#x2019;d ridden Star before, and liked her, but the horse was in a new stable, and horses could be quirky. Still, Star was seven years old. She seemed easygoing and content, no kind of diva.<br><br>The next time Courtney hoisted herself up into the saddle, she relaxed a bit. Beneath her, Star nickered and fidgeted, clearly announcing that she was bored.<br><br>Courtney nudged the buckskin horse with her knees and dug her heels into Star&#x2019;s sides, and they were off, galloping over a shimmering sea of sweet green grass. Never in her life, Courtney thought, would she experience anything to top the sheer soul-�soaring joy of galloping across a field on the back of this horse. She and Star became one creature, united by speed, motion, bliss, and on Courtney&#x2019;s part, a thrilling smidgen of terror. Star loved to run, and Courtney let her have her head. She felt the huffing of the huge animal&#x2019;s lungs beneath her, the silken glide of the powerful muscles carrying her.<br><br>In the distance, she spotted a stand of cottonwood trees. Easily jumping over a fallen white rail fence, she headed Star in their direction. As they drew closer, she saw a narrow creek winding along just a few feet from the trees. It was shady there, and Courtney was glad, because even with the temperature only in the low eighties, her clothes were sweat-�soaked from the ride. When they reached it, she reined Star in, took a moment to lean forward and pet her and whisper endearments to her. Her horse muttered and tossed her head, white saliva flying. Courtney dismounted and held the reins in her hand as Star drank from the creek.</p><h2>Fortune Furlough (Miss Fortune Mysteries)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s not a vacation until there&#x2019;s a murder.Fortune, Ida Belle, and Gertie are finally off to Florida on the vacation they&#x2019;ve always talked about.

Some of the origins of Hakomi stem from Buddhism and Taoism, especially concepts like gentleness, compassion, mindfulness and going with the grain. Other influences come from general systems theory, which incorporates the idea of respect for the wisdom of each individual as a living organic system that spontaneously organizes matter and energy and selects from the environment what it needs in a way that maintains its goals, programs and identity. Hakomi also draws from modern body-centered psychotherapies such as Reichian work, bioenergetics, Gestalt, Psychomotor, Feldenkrais, Structural Bodywork, Ericksonian Hypnosis, Focusing and Neurolinguistic Programming. Hakomi is really a synthesis of philosophies, techniques and approaches that has its own unique artistry, form and organic process.Ron Kurtz , a gifted therapist, writer and teacher, developed the Hakomi Method in the mid 1970s as the culmination of his previous study and experience in psychology, science and philosophy.

For the reader who thinks such things are only for true gourmets or <i>Metropolitan Home</i> magazine aesthetes, one look at the photographs in this book will seduce you. The images are so beautiful and unusual as to be hypnotic: rose petals served as a bowl of ice cream (Rose Petal Sorbet); salads that look like wildflower meadows.<p> Creasy interviews Alice Waters of Chez Panisse about her use of flowers in meals at her famous Berkeley restaurant; Waters recounts the curious effect cooking with flowers has on diners. "The flowers are a fascination. People really focus on them and are curious." This curiosity stems from a cluster of superstitions: that all flowers are somehow poisonous, that beautiful things should not be touched or consumed, that vegetables are the sturdy, useful plants while flowers are "for show." Reading <i>The Edible Flower Garden</i>, I remembered the summer I forgot to pick my artichokes, and they basked in the sun long after they were ripe. One day I looked out and it was as if a spell had been cast: the ugly green artichoke scales were gone, transformed into blinding purple flowers. Color is always hiding somewhere, and it is wonderful to allow it to flourish, like Creasy does, in places where it is not expected. <i>--Emily White</i></p><b>Rosalind Creasy,</b> a resident of Los Altos, California, is a landscape designer and leading authority on appropriate gardening techniques as well as a widely published garden writer and popular lecturer.

This book meets people coming to the battlefield just where they are, with concise and uncluttered maps that clearly and accurately lay out the major movements down to brigade level, on an hour-by-hour basis, and with a straightforward and easily followed narrative of each map&#x2019;s actions. Take it in the car, take it on foot, combine it with digital apps, or study it in advance--you will have the Battle of Gettysburg in easy grasp." (Allen C. Guelzo, author of Gettysburg: The Last Invasion 2013-03-18)<br><br>"This map-supported narrative of the Battle of Gettysburg will appeal to neophyte and expert alike. The hour-by-hour maps of the maneuvering and fighting provide the clearest cartographic picture of the battle in existence.

Scott Hartwig, author of To Antietam Creek 2013-03-19)<br><br>"Many attempts to depict the course of fighting on America&#x2019;s most iconic battlefield are either so general as to be misleading, or so specific as to be incomprehensible. This cartographic display is a nice compromise. The movements are depicted clearly, and in full color, so that even a complete newcomer to the battle can follow the action easily." (Craig L.

These essays appeared first in 1787-88 as a series of articles in New York City's newspapers to explain and defend the proposed Constitution of the United States. Ever since, they have been read and studied around the world for their examination of the challenges of constitution-making and the innovative features of the Constitution.</p><p>The authors of <i>The Federalist </i>were three of the greatest politicians and political thinkers in U.S. history: Alexander Hamilton and John Jay of New York, and James Madison of Virginia. Hamilton and Madison were delegates to the Federal Convention, which framed the Constitution; Jay helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which ended the American Revolution and won British recognition of American independence. The three men wrote under a pen-name, Publius, after the Roman Senator who led his countrymen in creating the government of the Roman Republic.</p><p>The editor, R. B. Bernstein, is a lecturer in political science at City College of New York and author of <i>Thomas Jefferson</i> and <i>The Founding Fathers: A Very Short Introduction</i>.</p></p><p>"This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren ... should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties." So wrote John Jay, one of the revolutionary authors of <i>The Federalist Papers,</i> arguing that if the United States was truly to be a single nation, its leaders would have to agree on universally binding rules of governance--in short, a constitution. In a brilliant set of essays, Jay and his colleagues Alexander Hamilton and James Madison explored in minute detail the implications of establishing a kind of rule that would engage as many citizens as possible and that would include a system of checks and balances. Their arguments proved successful in the end, and <i>The Federalist Papers</i> stand as key documents in the founding of the United States.Edited by R.B.

Jackson Jones, 11, transitions from Mr. Popular to complete loser in the time it takes to be fitted for braces with headgear. He soon happens upon the underground headquarters of a group of outcasts called NERDS, who, with the help of technology "upgrades," turn weaknesses like allergies into superpowers, fighting crime in secret until the age of 18. While trying to escape, Jackson himself is accidentally upgraded&#x2014;his braces become equipped with tiny nanobytes capable of morphing into any object. Asked to join the NERDS, Jackson quickly learns that not everyone wants him around&#x2014;especially those he used to pick on. Unity must come quickly, however, to foil the evil Dr. Jigsaw, whose mission to reunite the continents of the world will lead to massive destruction. The absurd story line humorously hits on some oft-ignored topics&#x2014;what is the difference between a goon, a henchman, a minion, and an assassin anyway? Readers will delight in these unexpected touches. The pacing is quick and the action is plentiful&#x2014;kids will almost hear the sound effects as they read. The book itself is treated as a top-secret NERDS case file, complete with increasingly ridiculous security-clearance requirements (thumbprint, saliva sample, money). Angular, black-and-white illustrations highlight main characters and pivotal moments. <i>NERDS</i> brings a worthy message to the fore&#x2014;that uncool kids can grow up to be anything but.

The author was at the peak of his earning power as a movie star when he suddenly quit. He walked out on Hollywood, walked out of a shattered marriage, defied the courts, broke as an outlaw, set sail with his four children in the schooner Wanderer--bound for the South Seas. His attempt to escape launched his autobiography. It is the candid, sometimes painfully revealing confession of a man who scrutinized his every self-defeat and self-betrayal in the unblinking light of conscience.</p><p>Sterling Hayden (1916-1986) is most widely known for his acting (Asphalt Jungle, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, and The Godfather). However, throughout his life he punctuated his acting stints with bouts of adventuring, or wandering. He started out as a humble dory fisherman in the Grand Banks, captained a two-masted brig from Boston to Tahiti, and sailed around the world twice, all before he appeared on film. After his first Hollywood period, he enlisted in the marines under a pseudonym, eventually working as an undercover agent for the OSS. He split his later years between a canal boat in Paris and an apartment in Sausalito where he wrote much of his novel, Voyage....one unforgettable voyage...under a captain whose words may echo in your mind and whose attitude may inform your spirit for the rest of your life. (<i>The Times (UK)</i>)<br><br>An impressive writer. Like Fitzgerald, Hayden is a romantic. His writing about the sea evokes echoes of Conrad and McFee, of London and Galsworthy...Beautifully done. (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>A superb piece of writing...Echoes from Poe and Melville to Steinbeck and Mailer. A work of fascination on every level. (<i>New York Post</i>)<br><br>Hayden's wonderful autobiography Wanderer ...should be in every main salon aboard every boat. Hayden's life can't be emulated, but it is instructive (<i>Ocean Navigator</i>)</p><h2>Long Journey Home: A Young Girl&#39;s Memoir of Surviving the Holocaust</h2><p>The summer of 1939 turned out to be the last summer of author Lucy Lipiner&#x2019;s childhood. On September 1, when she was six years old, her parents roused Lucy and her older sister from their beds, and with other relatives in tow fled their town of Sucha and the invasion by Nazi Germany . Their journey of survival was not easy, and in Long Journey Home: A Young Girl&#x2019;s Memoir of Surviving the Holocaust, from the perspective of that young girl, Lucy (Lusia) narrates her family&#x2019;s story. From her sheltered life in a small town at the foothills of Tatra Mountains to her time as a barefoot and hungry little girl in Siberia and Tajikistan in central Asia, and finally her arrival in America, this memoir shares the emotional details and the physical struggles of a ten-year flight to freedom. An extraordinary story of resilience, Long Journey Home is a detailed, historical account of a little known and rarely discussed group of Holocaust survivors.</p><p>I began writing my story shortly after visiting my old home in Sucha Beskidzka, Poland. I remembered so much from my early childhood - I was only six years old when Nazi Germany invaded Poland.<br><br>I wrote my story mainly for my children and the future generations. My children rarely ask questions about the war and what had happened to us during those years. I didn't want to leave my children with unanswered questions. My story is also dedicated to my father. For me, as a child he was a giant. But more than anything he was a true hero. Papa saved the lives of 15 people.<br><br>My book is dedicated to my mother as well. She lost her entire family in the Holocaust, it was a wound that never healed. Mama lived a long life, she reached the age of 101. Her mind was intact until the very end. For that reason her psyche, her mental suffering over her loss went on forever. She rarely spoke of her sisters and brothers. Her pain was evident when she read in the press about those who deny the Holocaust. So where are my sisters and brothers if there was no Holocaust, she'd say and tears would moisten her face. So I wrote my story for Mama too. I knew I would write about WW II, what it did to our lives and the loss of our entire family. I hoped that by telling my story, perhaps I would be putting a dent into the false theories of that small select group of people who deny the Holocaust.Suddenly, out of nowhere came a loud buzzing sound. Big black, angry birds appeared on the horizon. Within moments, the black birds became a uniform squadron of flying machines.<br><br>Pandemonium erupted around us, "German planes! German planes!" people shouted. Some began running, pushing, elbowing their way out of the crowds. Some were trampled on the ground. Some just stood and stared into the sky. In the midst of the turmoil, the sound of children sobbing was heard everywhere.<br><br>In spite of the noise around me, I heard Papa calling, "Raisil! Raisil! Run! Get away from the road! Run quick!" Mama stood a distance away. She just stood there. I'm not sure she heard him. Suddenly, I felt my hand being pulled. Papa was pushing against the crowds, dragging Frydzia and me away from the road into an open field....<br><br>We ran, and in an instant, we reached a tree thick with foliage.<br><br>Papa threw us to the ground and threw himself on top of us. It felt like a ton of bricks had fallen on top of me. I felt a chocking sensation in my throat. But very soon, Papa's strong arms gave a sense of being in a safe haven.</p><h2>The Penguin Italian Phrasebook: Fourth Edition (The Penguin Phrasebook Library)</h2><p><b>Keep your Italian close at hand with the perfect stylish companion for any traveler</b><br><br>This newly revised and updated Italian Phrase Book contains a wealth of useful words and phrases for travellers.

Reprint.</p><p>Tony Ross lives in London, England.Grade 1-3 Rancher Hicks leads a life so uneventful that he takes a trip to town just to see what is happening. Wife Elna stays home. While the rancher is amusing himself with the high life in Sleepy Gulchgetting his whiskers trimmed, having lunch at Millie Mildew's, and watching a turtle cross Main StreetElna is home winning contests, inheriting fortunes, starring in movies, and entertaining the President. Delightfully exaggerated, the happenings are contrasted spread by spread, switching back and forth from town to ranch with the phrase, ``Meanwhile, back at. . . .'' Double-page spreads accentuate the huge sky of the empty ranch, even after Elna's construction projects seem to fill the horizon. Ross places Elna and Rancher Hicks in a parody of an American Gothic pose that is filled with color and barely repressed merriment, wonderfully carrying out the wacky mood of Noble's tall tale. Rancher Hicks wears an expression of hilarious happiness while Elna accepts all that happens with breezy aplomb and regrets missing all the excitement in town.

Boys recording music made with an electric guitar and keyboard are juxtaposed with Edison's tinfoil phonograph. A boy listening to his sound mixer, a girl with a multi CD player, and a girl listening to her iPod are compared to dictation machines and the first talking doll. A boy making photocopies of his face is compared to Edison's electric pen. Modern moviemaking is linked to Edison's Kinetograph, the first movie camera, the Kinetoscope for viewing images, and the Kinetephone for projecting sounds with images. Edison's discovery of radio waves, development of telegraph technology, and a useful light bulb with a community-wide power system are showcased. This will be a useful tool to introduce history and inventions to reluctant readers or students as the book stays tightly focused on Edison's work rather than on his personal life.

Esoteric philosophies and personas&#x2014;from Freemasonry to Spiritualism, from Madame H. P. Blavatsky to Edgar Cayce&#x2014;dramatically altered the nation&#x2019;s culture, politics, and religion. Yet the mystical roots of our identity are often ignored or overlooked. Opening a new window on the past, <b>Occult America</b><i> </i>presents a dramatic, pioneering study of the esoteric undercurrents of our history and their profound impact across modern life.</p></p><p><strong>Book Description</strong><br> It touched lives as disparate as those of Frederick Douglass, Franklin Roosevelt, and Mary Todd Lincoln--who once convinced her husband, Abe, to host a s�ance in the White House. Americans all, they were among the famous figures whose paths intertwined with the mystical and esoteric movement broadly known as the occult. Brought over from the Old World and spread throughout the New by some of the most obscure but gifted men and women of early U.S. history, this &#x201c;hidden wisdom&#x201d; transformed the spiritual life of the still-young nation and, through it, much of the Western world.<br> <p>Yet the story of the American occult has remained largely untold. Now a leading writer on the subject of alternative spirituality brings it out of the shadows. Here is a rich, fascinating, and colorful history of a religious revolution and an epic of offbeat history.</p> <p>From the meaning of the symbols on the one-dollar bill to the origins of the Ouija board, Occult America briskly sweeps from the nation&#x2019;s earliest days to the birth of the New Age era and traces many people and episodes, including:</p> <p>� The spirit medium who became America&#x2019;s first female religious leader in 1776<br> � The supernatural passions that marked the career of Mormon prophet Joseph Smith<br> � The rural Sunday-school teacher whose clairvoyant visions instigated the dawn of the New Age<br> � The prominence of mind-power mysticism in the black-nationalist politics of Marcus Garvey<br> � The Idaho druggist whose mail-order mystical religion ranked as the eighth-largest faith in the world during the Great Depression</p> <p>Here, too, are America&#x2019;s homegrown religious movements, from transcendentalism to spiritualism to Christian Science to the positive-thinking philosophy that continues to exert such a powerful pull on the public today. A feast for believers in alternative spirituality, an eye-opener for anyone curious about the unknown byroads of American history, <em>Occult America</em> is an engaging, long-overdue portrait of one nation, under many gods, whose revolutionary influence is still being felt in every corner of the globe.</p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Mitch Horowitz on the Occult in American History</strong><br><br> Scholars of American history have often dismissed occult traditions, such as Spiritualism, Mesmerism, divination, channeling, and mental-healing, as little more than oddball social trends to be analyzed, fretted over, and debunked. This is a mistake. To really grasp the religious development of our nation, its occult movements and believers must be understood for what they are: communities of belief, who left a profound impact on the culture of America and the modern world.<br> <p>Early American history is entwined with esoteric spirituality. North America&#x2019;s first intentional mystical community reached its shores in the summer of 1694. That year, the determined spiritual philosopher Johannes Kelpius led about forty pilgrims out of Central Germany--a region decimated by the Thirty Years&#x2019; War--and to the banks of the Wissahickon Creek, just beyond Philadelphia. The city then hosted only about 500 houses, but it represented a Mecca of freedom for the Kelpius circle, who longed for a new homeland where they could practice their brands of astrology, alchemy, numerology, and mystical Christianity without fear of harassment from church or government.</p> <p>Soon more mystical thinkers from the Rhine Valley journeyed to America, building a larger commune at Ephrata, Pennsylvania. A young woman named Ann Lee fled persecution in her native Manchester, England and relocated her esoteric sect, the "Shaking Quakers"--or the Shakers--to upstate New York in 1776. That same year, a Rhode Island girl, Jemima Wilkinson, declared herself a spirit channeler, took the name Publick Universal Friend, and began to preach across the northeast. The trend was set: America became a destination for religious idealists, especially those of a supernatural bent.</p> <p>By the 1830s and 40s, a region of central New York State called "the Burned-Over District" (so-named for its religious passions) became the magnetic center for the religious radicalism sweeping the young nation. Stretching from Albany to Buffalo, it was the Mt. Sinai of American mysticism, giving birth to new religions such as Mormonism and Seventh-Day Adventism, and also to Spiritualism, mediumship, table-rapping, s�ances, and other occult sensations--many of which mirrored, and aided, the rise of Suffragism and related progressive movements. The nation&#x2019;s occult culture gave women their first opportunity to openly serve as religious leaders--in this case as spirit mediums, seers, and channlers. America&#x2019;s social and spiritual radicals were becoming joined, and the partnership would never fade.</p> <p>Indeed, the robust growth of occult and mystical movements in nineteenth-century America--aided by the influence of Freemasonry and Transcendentalism--helped transform the young nation into a laboratory for religious experiment and a launching pad for the revolutions in alternative and New Age spirituality that eventually swept the globe. In the early twentieth century, the new spiritual therapies--from meditation to mind-body healing to motivational thinking--began revolutionizing how religion was understood in contemporary times: not only as a source of salvation but as a means of healing. In this sense, occult America had changed our world. <em>--Mitch Horowitz</em></p>Mitch Horowitz is the editor in chief of Tarcher/Penguin.

They set off alone on foot over hundreds of miles until they finally found someone to take them in.

Her own identity has been so wrapped up in being the caretaker, navigator, penny counter, and decision maker that she&#x2019;s not sure how to let go of some responsibilities while still keeping a sense of herself. But when the past comes back with devastating force, Dicey sees just how necessary&#x2014;and painful&#x2014;letting go can be.</p><p>Cynthia Voigt won the Newbery Medal for <i>Dicey&#x2019;s Song</i>, the Newbery Honor Award for <i>A Solitary Blue</i>, and the National Book Award Honor for <i>Homecoming</i>, all part of the beloved Tillerman cycle.

Dicey thought. That wasn&#x2019;t the way things went for the Tillermans, ever. She wasn&#x2019;t about to let that get her down. She couldn&#x2019;t let it get her down &#x2014; that was what had happened to Momma.<br><br>Dicey lay on her back under the wide-branched paper mulberry tree. She opened her eyes and looked up. The paper mulberry had broad leaves that made a pool of shade in which she lay. Thick roots spread around her, making a kind of chair for her to lean on. She wore only shorts in the hot midday air. Her arms and chest were spattered and streaked with red paint, and the barn was completely painted, top to bottom, all four sides, patched and painted and looking good. The paint and sweat were drying on Dicey&#x2019;s body. She could hear the buzzing of insects and nothing else. For once she was alone, but she knew where everybody was.<br><br>Gram had taken James downtown in the motorboat. Gram was going to get groceries and James was going to the library to find some books for Dicey, on repairing and maintaining wooden boats. Maybeth was up in her room, doing some of the many extra assignments her teacher gave her, so she could catch up with the rest of the third graders and not be kept back again. Sammy was out back, on the other side of the old farmhouse, spading up fallow land to increase the size of the vegetable garden. Gram had said, right off, that they would have to do more planting next spring than she&#x2019;d done for years, with four more people to feed. Dicey suspected that Gram hadn&#x2019;t been sure how the children would feel about the work.<br><br>Well, Gram would learn about them. And they would learn about Gram. There would be some surprises for everyone, Dicey guessed. She knew Gram had already been surprised: at Dicey&#x2019;s reaction when her sailboat &#x2014; the one she had hoped over and dreamed over &#x2014; sank into the shallow water by Gram&#x2019;s dock. Even James was surprised by how calm she stayed, maybe because he had seen Dicey&#x2019;s face as they hauled it down the quarter-mile path through the marsh, seen her strain and pull and check to be sure the wheels they&#x2019;d removed from a wagon and fixed to the legs of the sawhorse cradle didn&#x2019;t fall off, seen how much it mattered to her.<br><br>Dicey had watched the water pouring in through the leaks where the boards had shrunk apart with all those years of drying out. She had watched &#x2014; they had all stood and watched, as the little boat filled up with water and settled quietly down onto the sandy bottom of the Chesapeake Bay.<br><br>&#x201c;I should have remembered,&#x201d; Gram had said. &#x201c;I knew, if only I remembered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sail in that,&#x201d; Sammy declared.<br><br>Dicey had stared down at the chipped paint on the gunwales of the boat, which still showed above the water. The boat was her lucky charm, her rabbit&#x2019;s foot, her horseshoe, her pot of gold, it was the prize she&#x2019;d set for herself for leading them from nowhere to somewhere. OK, she said to herself, thinking about what needed to be done. They&#x2019;d have to bail it before they could get it out of the water. Then they&#x2019;d have to take it back to the barn. She told James to find something to bail with. They&#x2019;d have to slide the cradle back into the water, it would probably take all four children to do that.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t rest a minute, do you,&#x201d; Gram had said. Dicey shook her head; she had already gotten used to her grandmother&#x2019;s way of asking questions without question marks. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;d do better to let it sit out here a day or so,&#x201d; Gram had advised. &#x201c;Let the wood soak up water, to swell up again. I knew that once, but I forgot. I&#x2019;m sorry, girl,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Dicey hadn&#x2019;t answered, just looked at Gram where she stood on the dock with the wind blowing her curly gray hair around her face.<br><br>&#x201c;Dicey doesn&#x2019;t mind, as long as she knows what to do about things,&#x201d; Maybeth told Gram.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that right,&#x201d; Gram asked Dicey.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess so,&#x201d; Dicey said.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you do when there&#x2019;s nothing you <i>can</i> do,&#x201d; Gram said.<br><br>&#x201c;I dunno, I do something else,&#x201d; Dicey said.<br><br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make sense,&#x201d; James pointed out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s illogical.&#x201d;<br><br>Gram looked around at all of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Which one of your sons built this boat?&#x201d; Dicey asked, but Gram had turned away to go back to the house and didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>Remembering that scene, Dicey reminded herself that they all had a lot of learning to do. The boat was back in the barn and she had to begin scraping off the old layers of paint. But not quite yet. Gram and James would be back soon, and they&#x2019;d have lunch, and then Dicey wanted to go downtown to see about a job. She&#x2019;d been thinking about what kind of job she could get, all those long first three days of school. There wasn&#x2019;t much else to think about in school. As far as she was concerned, about all school was good for was using up your days. Dicey hadn&#x2019;t talked to anyone, except to answer teachers&#x2019; questions. That was OK with her, because she had important things to think about. Getting a job, to bring in some money was one. Tillermans always needed more money, because there were so many of them to feed. Dicey knew Gram worried about that. For that matter, Dicey worried about that too, and had worried all her life, because at thirteen, she was the oldest. That worry about food had been her single biggest worry all summer long, when they had traveled down here, after Momma disappeared. The other worries &#x2014; about what James was thinking, because what James thought in his head told him what to do; about whether or not Maybeth was retarded as people claimed, or only shy, slow, and frightened, which was what Dicey thought; about why Sammy was so angry he hit out and didn&#x2019;t mind how much the person he fought with hurt him; &#x2014; those worries, and worries about how much Dicey should give up for her brothers and sisters in order to have any kind of home together &#x2014; or if she was driving them too hard; about how many miles they had covered and where they were ever going &#x2014; all the other worries had come and gone. The worry about food had haunted her all summer long, and maybe it always would.<br><br>There were still things to worry about here, but nothing crucial. James said everything was all right now, now they could live with Gram. James was smart, but he wanted everything to be all right so badly that he couldn&#x2019;t see &#x2014;<br><br>Couldn&#x2019;t see what? Dicey asked herself. She hunkered up, resting her back against the tree.<br><br>Couldn&#x2019;t see how big troubles had little beginnings, just like little troubles.<br><br>Dicey heard voices approaching the house from behind. Nobody ever came up the front driveway. Gram didn&#x2019;t have a car and couldn&#x2019;t drive. She always went downtown in the motorboat. So except for the children&#x2019;s bicycles, the overgrown tracks that led off from the front of the house, through a stand of pines and between two long barren fields to the road, were unmarked. The voices came clearer.<br><br>Lazily, Dicey stood up and went around to help carry in bags of groceries. When she got around back, Sammy had taken the extra bag in his grubby arms. His face appeared at the top, streaked with dirt. Dicey looked at him and grinned, and made a mental note to tell Gram that he was having his seventh birthday next week. James trailed up through the garden, carrying another bag.<br><br>&#x201c;You two are a mess,&#x201d; Gram announced, before she even went up the back steps. She looked at Dicey and hesitated, as if deciding whether or not to say what she was thinking. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too old to go around half-naked,&#x201d; she announced.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Dicey demanded. &#x201c;I am not.&#x201d; Gram was already in the kitchen. &#x201c;Am I, James?&#x201d; Dicey asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You know, Dicey,&#x201d; he said. His eyes shifted away from hers. At ten he was old enough to be embarrassed. He hurried after Gram.<br><br>Well, she guessed she did know. She guessed she had noticed when she had stripped off her T-shirt that her breasts seemed to be pointing out &#x2014; maybe. But she had convinced herself that wasn&#x2019;t true. Dicey shrugged. There wasn&#x2019;t much she could do about getting a bosom, but she didn&#x2019;t have to like it.<br><br>Gram made a plate of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch, and she had put out a bowl of apples. Dicey had washed off most of the paint with turpentine. Then she and Sammy rinsed off with a quick swim, and she had put her shirt on. Sammy&#x2019;s yellow hair was slicked down.<br><br>James was on his third sandwich and Maybeth was still nibbling at her first. &#x201c;How did it go?&#x201d; Gram asked. &#x201c;How many pages did you get read?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four,&#x201d; Maybeth answered softly, without looking up. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not enough,&#x201d; she added.<br><br>Gram looked at Dicey, and Dicey sighed. &#x201c;Is the book too hard?&#x201d; Dicey asked her sister&#x2019;s bent head. Maybeth&#x2019;s hair was as bright as sunlight, and she&#x2019;d tied it back with a red ribbon. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you find the ribbon?&#x201d; Dicey asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Gram got it for me,&#x201d; Maybeth said. She looked up at Dicey then, with a little smile. Dicey liked the way Maybeth looked, like an angel, a Christmas angel. It was partly her wide, hazel eyes and her soft hair that curled gently at the ends; but more, it was the quiet ways she had. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s pretty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Dicey assured her. She, herself, like James, had their father&#x2019;s straight brown hair. Which was about all they had of their father, that and the narrow face; Maybeth and Sammy looked like Momma &#x2014; round and fair. But Dicey and James were mixes: Yet all the Tillermans had hazel eyes. She couldn&#x2019;t remember the color of their father&#x2019;s eyes, or exactly what he looked like; just his voice. Not surprising since she was seven the last time she saw him. &#x201c;Was the book too hard?&#x201d; she asked again.<br><br>Maybeth shook her head. &#x201c;I have to keep working, Mrs. Jackson said,&#x201d; she told Dicey. &#x201c;Only I can&#x2019;t remember what the words are, so I have to go back and memorize the lists again. If I work, Mrs. Jackson says, everything will be all right.&#x201d;<br><br>Dicey wanted to cooperate with this Mrs. Jackson. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do fractions after dinner,&#x201d; she promised Maybeth, who nodded with no more enthusiasm than Dicey felt. &#x201c;Is it OK if I go downtown this afternoon?&#x201d; she asked her grandmother. &#x201c;The barn is finished,&#x201d; she added, to distract her grandmother from any question about what Dicey wanted to do in town.<br><br>Gram looked as if she knew Dicey wanted to distract her. But she didn&#x2019;t know why. She decided not to ask. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pleased it&#x2019;s done,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t sound pleased,&#x201d; Sammy pointed out.<br><br>&#x201c;Appearances,&#x201d; Gram declared, &#x201c;can be deceiving.&#x201d;<br><br>Sammy thought about that. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Gram snorted. &#x201c;Because you can&#x2019;t judge a book by its cover.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Sammy wondered.<br><br><b>DICEY HAD DECIDED</b> to ask Millie Tydings, who owned the little grocery store down by the water at the foot of the one main street, if she had a job open. The store wasn&#x2019;t ever busy, at least not ever when Dicey was in there. She wondered if anybody besides Gram shopped there, and she couldn&#x2019;t blame them. Millie didn&#x2019;t keep the windows or floors particularly clean. Dust gathered on the cans and boxes on unwashed shelves. The meat and fish counter, behind which Millie worked most of the time, got wiped down every day, Dicey guessed from the way the white enamel gleamed. Millie might be lazy, she might just be too tired (and Dicey guessed if she had to tote that body around every day, all day long, she&#x2019;d get tired too), or she might just not care. Whatever the reason, Dicey figured there was a lot of work she could do in Millie&#x2019;s store.<br><br>Dicey leaned her bike up against the grimy plate glass window and entered the dim little store. Millie was at the back, leaning against the top of the meat counter. &#x201c;What can I do for you today?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Your grandmother forget something?&#x201d; Her little blue eyes rested lazily on Dicey. She had gray hair that she braided into circles around her head.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Dicey answered. &#x201c;I came to ask you if you might give me a job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A job? Why? Why should I do that? I don&#x2019;t make enough to keep myself in comfortable shoes,&#x201d; Millie told her.<br><br>&#x201c;But if I kept the place cleaner, more people would want to come and shop,&#x201d; Dicey argued. &#x201c;If I washed the windows and the floors and dusted off the shelves and the cans and the boxes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My Herbie used to do that,&#x201d; Millie said, &#x201c;before he died. Business isn&#x2019;t good,&#x201d; she told Dicey.<br><br>Dicey made herself be patient. She&#x2019;d just been talking about that, and how to make it better. &#x201c;But it should be,&#x201d; she argued. She&#x2019;d thought about this all the long bike ride into town. &#x201c;I mean, you have the only grocery store right downtown, the only store that people can walk to. The supermarkets are way out on the edge of town, and people have to drive there. It would be more convenient for people to come to you. If your store looked nicer they would want to.&#x201d;<br><br>Millie seemed to be thinking about this. &#x201c;Business used to be better,&#x201d; she finally said.<br><br>Dicey stared at the woman, at the heavy mottled flesh of her face. She thought maybe Millie wasn&#x2019;t very smart at all. She&#x2019;d never thought of that before. If that was the case, how would she go about convincing Millie to give her a job?<br><br>&#x201c;I think business could be better, if the store looked better,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Millie&#x2019;s eyes moved slowly around, studying the narrow aisles. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s dirty,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But not back here,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always passed the health department inspection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good butcher,&#x201d; Dicey said, trying a little flattery. &#x201c;Gram says so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Millie smiled at this. &#x201c;Did she really?&#x201d; Dicey nodded, it was the truth. &#x201c;Ab always was smart and quick. You know, we all &#x2014; all of us in school &#x2014; hankered after John Tillerman. He was so handsome and dignified, you know?&#x201d; Dicey nodded, even though she didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;But it was Ab he courted. There were some tears shed over that, I can tell you.&#x201d; Millie nodded her big head wisely.<br><br>Dicey didn&#x2019;t know how to get the conversation back on the track she wanted. &#x201c;Gram says your husband taught you how to be a butcher.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When we got married, that&#x2019;s right. I wasn&#x2019;t so fat then,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We never did have any children.&#x201d; She relapsed into silence.<br><br>&#x201c;If I worked here,&#x201d; Dicey said finally, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s lots I could do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to be in school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean, maybe after school for an hour, maybe Saturdays in the mornings.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t be very long. So it wouldn&#x2019;t cost me very much. I&#x2019;d like the company,&#x201d; Millie said. &#x201c;How much were you thinking of me paying?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A dollar an hour,&#x201d; Dicey said. She was under age, so she couldn&#x2019;t charge much.<br><br>Millie thought about this, her fat sausage-shaped fingers working on the countertop.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought, if I worked four days a week after school, and then three hours on Saturday,&#x201d; Dicey said.<br><br>The fingers moved. &#x201c;That would be seven dollars a week,&#x201d; Millie announced. Dicey nodded. She figured, with seven dollars, she could give each of the little kids an allowance of a dollar a week and the rest to Gram. Except &#x2014; now she changed that plan &#x2014; she&#x2019;d give herself an allowance too. They&#x2019;d never had allowances. Momma never had any extra money at all to be able to count on to give them. So when they wanted paper or pencils for school, or shoelaces, they had to ask her, and her face got all worried until she figured out where to find the extra money.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Millie said.<br><br>&#x201c;We could try it,&#x201d; Dicey offered. &#x201c;I could work for three weeks on trial. Then, if your business wasn&#x2019;t getting better, you could fire me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never fired anybody, I don&#x2019;t know how,&#x201d; Millie objected.<br><br>&#x201c;You see,&#x201d; Dicey spoke urgently, &#x201c;my theory is that your business will get better, and so instead of costing you money, I&#x2019;d be making you money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you thin...</p><h2>The Two Princesses of Bamarre</h2><p><p><em>A kingdom beset by monsters . . .<br>A disease that weakens and destroys . . .<br>An epic poem and a hero of long ago . . .<br>A story of danger and desperation.</em></p><p>The two princesses of Bamarre couldn't be more different.

Twelve-year-old Addie admires her older sister Meryl, who aspires to rid the kingdom of Bamarre of gryphons, specters, and ogres. Addie, on the other hand, is fearful even of spiders and depends on Meryl for courage and protection. Waving her sword Bloodbiter, the older girl declaims in the garden from the heroic epic of Drualt to a thrilled audience of Addie, their governess, and the young sorcerer Rhys. But when Meryl falls ill with the dreaded Gray Death, Addie must gather her courage and set off alone on a quest to find the cure and save her beloved sister. Addie takes the seven-league boots and magic spyglass left to her by her mother and the enchanted tablecloth and cloak given to her by Rhys--along with a shy declaration of his love. She prevails in encounters with tricky specters (spiders too) and outwits a wickedly personable dragon in adventures touched with romance and a bittersweet ending. Young fans of princess stories will gobble this one up.

These women came from all walks of life but had one thing in common: a desire for freedom. History has largely ignored these female swashbucklers, until now. Here are their stories, from ancient Norse warriors like Awilda, Stikla, and Rusla; to Sayyida al-Hurra of the Barbary corsairs; from Grace O&#x2019;Malley, who terrorized shipping operations around the British Isles; to Cheng I Sao, who commanded a fleet of 400 ships off China in the early 19th century. Author Laura Sook Duncombe also looks beyond the stories to the storytellers and mythmakers. What biases and agendas motivated them? What did they leave out? <i>Pirate Women </i>explores why and how these stories are told and passed down and how history changes depending on who is recording it. It&#x2019;s the largest overview of women pirates in one volume and chock-full of swashbuckling adventures. In this book, pirate women are pulled from the shadows into the spotlight that they deserve.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Laura Sook Duncombe</b> is a lawyer and a writer whose work on women pirates has appeared on <i>Jezebel</i>.

His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.&nbsp; <p>His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for&nbsp;<i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, and received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for lifetime contribution to children's literature in 2011.</p> <p>DePaola has published almost 200 children's books in&nbsp;15 different countries over the past 30 years.&nbsp;Among his most well-known titles are the <i>Strega Nona </i>series, <i>26 Fairmount Avenue</i>, and <i>The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush.</i></p> <p>DePaola lives in an interesting house in New Hampshire with his four dogs. His studio is in a large renovated 200-year-old barn.</p>Grade 3-5-This picture-book biography is a good way to introduce youngsters to this avant-garde Mexican painter. Told from the viewpoint of a girl who is doing a report on the famous artist, Kahlo's story is clear, concise, and accessible. All of the basic facts are here, along with many personal details that enliven the narrative. Frith does a particularly good job of explaining artistic terms within the text, and she also focuses on qualities that make Kahlo's work unique. The book concludes with three questions that the student would ask the artist if she could-a great technique for prompting children to do more research on this fascinating painter. The well-written prose is beautifully complemented both by photos of Kahlo and of some of her best-known paintings and by dePaola's splendid trademark illustrations, all set against vividly colored backgrounds. Many of the colors used are those found in Kahlo's own works. The tone of dePaola's paintings varies from humorous to realistic, showcasing his ability to reveal both the light and more serious sides of his subject. His use of color and patterned "frames" gives each illustration a vivacity that underscores Kahlo's own zest for life. Written for a slightly older audience than Jonah Winter's Frida (Scholastic, 2002), this is a fine choice for all libraries.<br><i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Montana Sky</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts surpasses herself once again, with a novel as sweeping and extraordinary as the Montana sky itself...</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> When Jack Mercy died, he left behind a ranch worth nearly twenty million dollars.

Since its publication in 2003, it has been recognized as having contributed to a better understanding among the general public of the history of the Antillean cultures before, during and after the arrival of the Europeans.Over the years, I have received a considerable number of requests from people around the world expressing their desire that the book be made available in English. Tainos and Caribs: The Aboriginal Cultures of the Antilles was inspired by those demands. I hope that the English edition broadens the reach of knowledge from anthropologists, historians, archeologists, linguists, artists and others about the Tainos and the Caribs, two cultures that have captivated my interest and imagination for over 25 years.The original design of the book was made with great care by my daughter Claudia. This English edition reviews and updates the original text and bibliography. The complete translation from Spanish was carried out meticulously by my daughter Grace, whose great effort and enthusiasm makes this edition possible. I thank both of them for their wholehearted commitment and devotion in the publication and dissemination of this work. Sebasti�n Robiou Lamarche, Author. &#34;I knew this book would become a classic from the moment I read it in 2004. It has characteristics that distinguish it from other books on the ancient Caribbean. Notably, Robiou recognizes that Taino and Carib societies were not simple. Quite the opposite, he describes them as vibrant and sophisticated. This revision and English edition is well-timed because recent developments reaffirm the composite view of the Caribbean presented in the original publication&#34;. L. Antonio Curet, Curator, Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of the American Indian, Washington, D.C. &#34;Tainos and Caribs marks a milestone in the historiography of the indigenous Caribbean. Based on diverse primary sources (archaeological, linguistic, ethnohistorical), Robiou Lamarche offers a great synthesis and an in-depth analysis of the Taino chiefdoms and the Carib tribes, explored as a whole, pointing elegantly to their interconnections and their specificities. The author has the virtue, in turn, to sharply examine multiple topics that include social structures, religion, rituals and beliefs. It is required reading on the emergence of the indigenous societies of the ancient Caribbean&#34;. Francisco Moscoso, Universidad de Puerto Rico, R�o Piedras. &#34;The author presents to us sequentially the main cultures that inhabited the Antilles before and during the European impact. For both the Tainos and the Caribs, he explains the main elements of their material and ideal life, highlighting their likeness as well as their differences. A brilliant research work based on archeological and ethnohistorical information&#34;. Lourdes Dom�nguez, Oficina del Historiador de La Habana, Cuba. &#34;The book is a significant contribution to the knowledge of the aboriginal world view in the Antilles. The author analyzes - among other aspects - the intimate correlation that exists between astronomical systems, climatological cycles and magic-religious beliefs, as well as agricultural practices linked to fertility rites. In the same way, his research on the bateyes or ceremonial plazas in the Antilles make plausible the existence of a solar calendar in the process of development and of myth-astronomy in the pre-Columbian islands&#34;.

In <i>Strangers Drowning</i>, Larissa MacFarquhar seeks out people living lives of extreme ethical commitment and tells their deeply intimate stories; their stubborn integrity and their compromises; their bravery and their recklessness; their joys and defeats and wrenching dilemmas.<br><br> A couple adopts two children in distress. But then they think: If they can change two lives, why not four? Or ten? They adopt twenty. But how do they weigh the needs of unknown children in distress against the needs of the children they already have?<br> &nbsp;<br> Another couple founds a leprosy colony in the wilderness in India, living in huts with no walls, knowing that their two small children may contract leprosy or be eaten by panthers. The children survive. But what if they hadn&#x2019;t? How would their parents&#x2019; risk have been judged?<br><br> A woman believes that if she spends money on herself, rather than donate it to buy life-saving medicine, then she&#x2019;s responsible for the deaths that result. She lives on a fraction of her income, but wonders: when is compromise self-indulgence and when is it essential?<br><br> We honor such generosity and high ideals; but when we call people do-gooders there is skepticism in it, even hostility. Why do moral people make us uneasy? Between her stories, MacFarquhar threads a lively history of the literature, philosophy, social science, and self-help that have contributed to a deep suspicion of do-gooders in Western culture.<br><br> Through its sympathetic and beautifully vivid storytelling, <i>Strangers Drowning</i> confronts us with fundamental questions about what it means to be human. In a world of strangers drowning in need, how much should we help, and how much can we help? Is it right to care for strangers even at the expense of those we are closest to? Moving and provocative, <i>Strangers Drowning</i> challenges us to think about what we value most, and why.</p></p><p>LARISSA MACFARQUHAR has been a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1998. Her subjects have included John Ashbery, Barack Obama, and Noam Chomsky, among many others. Previously she was a senior editor at <i>Lingua Franca</i> and an advisory editor at <i>The Paris Review</i>. MacFarquhar lives in New York.&#x201c;[Strangers Drowning] really made me think about morality, doing good, the lengths some humans are capable of in terms of altruism, and my own limitations. This is such a thoughtful, philosophical book that doesn't beat you over the head with a message because the message is: Here are people, these are their stories, make of it what you can, but don't dare mock or demonize them. We are human because we are different and have different capabilities.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Sarah Weinman, Publishers Lunch Favorite Books of 2015&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can imagine Larissa MacFarquhar&#x2019;s &#x2018;Strangers Drowning&#x2019; being as wonderful to read a hundred years from now as it was this year. The book reports on extreme &#x2018;do-gooders&#x2019;&#x2014;a favorite chapter looks at a couple who adopted 22 children&#x2014;but its detail-oriented and nonjudgmental intelligence makes it at once morally complex and mythic, modern and timeless.&#x201d;&#x2014; Rivka Galchen<i>, The New York Times Book Review </i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...The keys to the book&#x2019;s success are MacFarquhar&#x2019;s exhaustive journalistic approach and her clear, concise writing...<i>Strangers Drowning</i> is a brilliant jumping-off point to explore where each of us stands morally.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;MacFarquhar describes [the altruists&#x2019;] motivations in elegant, empathetic terms...The stories resound with the universality of fables, events unfold at their own pace, and the overall tone of&nbsp;<i>Strangers Drowning,&nbsp;</i>with its panoramic view of actions and their consequences, seems to draw from the texts of psychology, philosophy, and religion in equal measure, evoking the case study, the thought experiment, and the parable.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Bookforum&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Engaging...MacFarquhar...writes full and nuanced profiles, often by letting her subjects speak for themselves. She doesn&#x2019;t cast judgment on their ideals or their struggles to live up to them.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i> <br><br>&#x201c;MacFarquhar...tackles these questions with great intelligence and empathy...Thanks to MacFarquhar&#x2019;s curiosity and insight, and her embrace of complexity and ambiguity in storytelling, these portraits don&#x2019;t read at all like a secular version of &#x2018;Lives of the Saints&#x2019;...[They have a] richness and tenderness...with all their telling details, unexpected turns and wonderfully novelistic observations.&#x201d;&#x2014;H�ctor Tobar, <i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br> &#x201c;MacFarquhar&#x2019;s argument builds quietly, shown rather than told. The bibliography attests to the fact that she has immersed herself in the relevant literature but her reading is so subterranean that you hardly notice.&nbsp;Strangers Drowning&nbsp;is a book written in a deceptively simple and clear voice about&nbsp;people, about how morality lodges itself in a person not as an abstract idea, or even a value, but as a direction for life...MacFarquhar forgoes the knowing detachment of the interviewer and stays close to her subjects, narrating their lives in her own voice but in what seems to be as faithful a mode as possible...Its ultimate effect is impressive and, one senses, a matter of principle. To allow the do-gooders to explain themselves on their own terms is to give them what society has never quite managed &#x2014; the benefit of the doubt<i>.&#x201d;&#x2014;Financial Times</i><b> </b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;One part modern-day&nbsp;Lives of the Saints,&nbsp;one part confirmation that this is no age for saints...Brilliant.&#x201d;&#x2014;Laura Miller, <i>Slate</i> <br><br>&#x201c;MacFarquhar&#x2019;s narrative alternates beautifully between profiles of individual do-gooders and this history of ideas that undermine their work. She returns us to the age-old questions about how to live, not by thinking in philosophical abstractions or hypothetical scenarios but through the lived experience of real people&#x2014;their psychology, influences, relationships, triumphs, and shortcomings: the messy place where ethics actually lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New Republic</i><b> </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ms. MacFarquhar...has a vivid writing style, and her perspective is unfailingly compassionate...Her subjects emerge as fully human despite personal eccentricities, selfish tendencies and nonstandard ideas about how to live a moral life.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>&#x201c;Elegant, engaging, empathetic, and profoundly humane... Strangers Drowning&nbsp;is full of insights, inspiring and unsettling.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Psychology Today</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Superb...Ms. MacFarquhar&#x2019;s book...both streamlines and complicates the issues surrounding deep ethical scruples. She opens moral trapdoors you didn&#x2019;t know were there. More interestingly, she opens ones you suspect she didn&#x2019;t know were there, either. This writer does so many things well in &#x2018;Strangers Drowning&#x2019; that it&#x2019;s hard to know where to begin...[MacFarquhar&#x2019;s profiles] are as taut and evocative as parables...[and] don&#x2019;t swamp the inquisitive tone of her broader intellectual narrative...The author&#x2019;s tone throughout &#x2018;Strangers Drowning&#x2019; is that of a serious and wide-awake novelist. You sense a great deal of sifting below the surface of Ms. MacFarquhar&#x2019;s sentences, a reserve of power and intellect drawn upon at will. If her book does not provoke and unsettle you, you may not have a pulse.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i><br>&#x201c;Thought-provoking...Such ethical urgency, with its aura of perfectionist virtue and saintly sanctimony, stirs ambivalence in most of us. If MacFarquhar thought she might overcome it, she&#x2019;s too honest to pretend she did. These do-gooders aren&#x2019;t moral models. But her discomfiting portraits deliver a humanizing surprise: Few of these altruistic souls nurse any illusion that they are exemplars.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The Atlantic&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;In a series of sensitive case studies, acclaimed journalist MacFarquhar examines lives of the full-time do-gooders who give it their all and then some...MacFarquhar&#x2019;s book is a careful meditation on what it means to fully commit to moral&nbsp;living&#x2014;and whether the all-out commitments of this kind are, in the grand scheme of things, worth it.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Magazine <br></i><br> &#x201c;Gripping...The aim of the book is neither to urge readers to change their lives nor to suggest that do-gooders&nbsp;are deluded. Instead, MacFarquhar draws attention to a fact of life that we often prefer to sweep under&nbsp;the psychological rug: Sometimes we prioritize our moral duty to others, and sometimes we prioritize ourselves. Everyone draws that jagged line somewhere.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Pacific Standard &nbsp;<br></i><br> &#x201c;Thoughtful and wide-ranging...[MacFarquhar] lucidly illustrates both the benefits and shortcomings of this ethical position by focusing on the lives of several do-gooders...MacFarquhar offers readers plenty of food for thought in understand�ing the motivations and compul�sions of those who sacrifice every�thing in pursuit of a noble cause.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>BookPage &nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;Fascinating and terrifying portraits of saints and ministers of grace.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Kirkus </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gripping...A scrupulous study of people selflessly devoted to helping others...Engrossing and thought provoking.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Publishers &nbsp;Weekly</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;MacFarquhar's book--daringly conceived, brilliantly executed--may change not just how you see the world, but how you live in it.&#x201d;<br> <i>- Katherine Boo, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of Behind the Beautiful Forevers</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;In this inspiring yet deeply unsettling book, we are confronted with goodness at its most extreme. These arresting anecdotes from the shadowland between altruism and masochism are told in glowing, evocative prose and with polemical urgency. Few books throw one&#x2019;s personal moral universe into question, but this one does, and it does so powerfully and monumentally and with a near infinity of nuance and compassion.&#x201d;<br> <i>- Andrew Solomon, New York Times bestselling author of The Noonday Demon and Far From the Tree</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> "With the inquisitive mind of a philosopher, the observant eye of a reporter, and the ability to write like the finest novelist, Larissa MacFarquhar has created an extraordinary work of nonfiction.

These fascinating stories and Larissa MacFarquhar's own wise, funny meditations force you to inquire into your own sense of charity (or lack thereof). Easily the best book on both prescriptive and applied ethics I've read in a decade &#x2013; mandatory reading for the examined life.&#x201d;<br> <i>- Mary Karr, author of Lit and The Liars&#x2019; Club </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Larissa MacFarquhar is a beautiful writer, and Strangers Drowning is a beautiful, unique book, full of astonishing and sometimes wild tales of extraordinary altruism.

He shows actors how to undertake auditions and rehearsals, deal with agents and directors, engage audiences, and stay faithful to the script, while rejecting the temptations that seduce so many of their colleagues. Bracing in its clarity, exhilarating in its common sense, <i>True and False</i> is&nbsp;as shocking as it is practical, as witty as it is instructive, and as irreverent as it is inspiring.</p><p>To hell with Stanislavsky. To hell with the Method. "The actor is onstage to communicate the play to the audience," says David Mamet. "That is the beginning and the end of his and her job. To do so the actor needs a strong voice, superb diction, a supple, well-proportioned body and a rudimentary understanding of the play." Anything else--"becoming" one's part, "feeling" the character's emotions--devalues the practice of a noble craft and is useless to the play. "The 'work' you do 'on the script' will make no difference," he cautions. "That work has already been done by a person with a different job title than yours. That person is the author."<p> But <i>True and False</i> does not confine itself to the work done on the actual stage. Its brief essays contain sound advice on how an actor might apply himself or herself to the <i>life</i> of the actor: the proper consideration due the audition process, the selection of parts that one accepts, and so on. Mamet delivers these kernels of wisdom in the taut, no-nonsense prose for which he is justifiably famous, and, ultimately, his core principles are applicable beyond the theater. "Speak up, speak clearly, open yourself out, relax your body, find a simple objective," he instructs. "Practice in these goals is practice in respect for the audience, and without respect for the audience, there is no respect for the theater; there is only self-absorption." Substitute "others" for "the audience" and "life" for "the theater," and could any Taoist say it better? <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>"This book should be read and considered by everyone who acts."<br>--Steve Martin<br><br>"Entertaining and enlightening...Mamet's new book on the actor's life makes me proud to be a participant in that life."<br> --Joe Mantegna<br><br>"This is a very important book. No one has defined the actor's job better than Mamet. So much of the acting we see these days is, in my opinion, emotional glop. The actors are not really acting the story, they are acting what the story means. When all is said and done, it's just indicating. And as Mamet so outrageously and compellingly shows us, the future belongs to those actors who don't indicate at all, ever."<br>--William H. Macy<br><br>"I agree with almost nothing Mr. Mamet says in this book and encourage you to devour every word. Mamet is a genius."<br>--Alec Baldwin</p><h2>Deliciously Ella The Plant-Based Cookbook: 100 Simple Vegan Recipes to Make Every Day Delicious</h2><p>100 all-new plant-based recipes - by bestselling author Deliciously Ella.

Raised by a poor immigrant family in a tiny Tel Aviv apartment, baby Itzhak was transformed by the sounds from his family&#x2019;s kitchen radio&#x2014;graceful classical symphonies, lively klezmer tunes, and soulful cantorial chants. The rich melodies and vibrant rhythms spoke to him like magic, filling his mind with vivid rainbows of color. After begging his parents for an instrument, Itzhak threw his heart and soul into playing the violin. Despite enormous obstacles&#x2014;including a near-fatal bout of polio that left him crippled for life&#x2014;Itzhak persevered, honing his extraordinary gift.

He expands his business into foreclosure defense, only to see one of his clients accused of killing the banker she blames for trying to take away her home. <br><br>Mickey puts his team into high gear to exonerate Lisa Trammel, even though the evidence and his own suspicions tell him his client is guilty. Soon after he learns that the victim had black market dealings of his own, Haller is assaulted, too -- and he's certain he's on the right trail. <br><br>Despite the danger and uncertainty, Haller mounts the best defense of his career in a trial where the last surprise comes after the verdict is in. Connelly proves again why he "may very well be the best novelist working in the United States today" (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>).</p><p><b>Michael Connelly</b> is the author of twenty-seven previous novels, including the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Burning Room</i> and <i>The Gods of Guilt.</i>His books, which include the Harry Bosch series and Lincoln Lawyer series, have sold more than sixty million copies worldwide. Connelly is a former newspaper reporter who has won numerous awards for his journalism and his novels and is the executive producer of <i>Bosch,</i> starring Titus Welliver. He spends his time in California and Florida.<p>*Starred Review* Crime-fiction megastar Connelly can always be counted on to try something a little different. In The Reversal (2010), his last Mickey Haller novel, starring the L.A. lawyer who prefers to work out of his Lincoln Town Car, Connelly offered a tour de force of plotting on multiple levels. Here, he narrows the focus considerably, concentrating almost exclusively on what happens inside the courtroom but bringing to the traditional give-and-take of prosecutor, defender, judge, and jury an altogether more complex commingling of personality and legal strategy than is typically on view in legal thrillers. He accomplishes this with a particularly rich first-person narration in which Haller takes us through the courtroom drama as it happens, noting his blunders and praising himself for quick-thinking improvisations. It doesn't hurt, either, that the plot is meaty: a woman whom Haller was representing in a suit against the bank attempting to foreclose on her mortgage is accused of killing the bank official in charge of foreclosures. Combining ripped-from-the-headlines information on the mortgage crisis with a cast of characters that defies stereotypes at every turn of the plot, Connelly shows once again that he will never simply ride the wave of past success. And, neither, apparently, will Mickey Haller, as he reveals a shocking change of direction in the novel's final pages. </p> <p>HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Connelly's latest Mickey Haller novel will benefit from the release in March of a movie version of The Lincoln Lawyer, the first Haller novel, starring Matthew McConaughey. 750,000 first printing. --Bill Ott</p></p><h2>A General History of the Pyrates</h2><p>A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson was published in 1724.

Are you tired of being discouraged in your walk with the Lord? Has your joy been left along the wayside somewhere? Be of good cheer! The powerful truths outlined in this book will help you find your joy and get you back on the track of being a victor instead of a victim! Satan wants your joy, and he wants it badly. Stop him in his tracks by learning: - How God s Word produces joy - Why Satan wants your joy - How Satan steals your joy - How to make Satan return what he has stolen (sevenfold!) - How to laugh more and cry less Stop being an open target for the enemy&#39;s attacks. It&#39;s time to turn the tables and put the enemy on the defense!</p><p>Jerry Savelle is a noted author, evangelist, and teacher who travels extensively throughout the United States, Canada, and around the globe.

Slavery. Power. Redemption.</strong></p><p>We think we know the story of Joseph&#x2015;the young man sold into slavery by his own brothers before rising to immense power over all of Egypt. But is it possible that we&#x2019;ve missed the <em>real</em> story behind the story?</p><p>In <em>Joseph and the Gospel of Many Colors</em>, Voddie Baucham Jr. helps us to understand the crucial role that the story of Joseph plays in redemptive history. Engaging and thoughtful, this book will help you read the Bible from a Christ-centered perspective and revitalize your love for God&#x2015;the true hero of history.</p></p><p><p><strong>Voddie Baucham Jr.</strong> (DMin, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) is dean of the seminary at African Christian University in Lusaka,&nbsp;Zambia. The author of a number of books, including&nbsp;<em>Family Driven Faith</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Ever-Loving Truth</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Joseph and the Gospel of Many&nbsp;Colors</em>, Baucham is also a pastor, church planter, and conference speaker.</p><p>Dean, African Christian University Seminary; author, <em>Family Driven Faith</em></p><p>&#x201c;Here is a popular-level reading of the life of Joseph as it is found in Genesis&#x2015;an approach that reads the narrative both within the framework of Genesis and within the framework of the entire Bible. It avoids mere moralism, but does not overlook the morals implicit in the story; it avoids finding Jesus hiding behind every verse in some earnest but skewed and uncontrolled appeal to typology, yet it shows how the narrative prepares the way for Jesus. In many ways these chapters foster quiet, patient, faithful Bible reading, while driving readers toward the gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. A. Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;Voddie Baucham has thrown a spanner in the works of those writers and preachers who see little more in the biblical narratives than unrelated moral and spiritual lessons that are ingeniously applied directly to us. By identifying vital theological dimensions that unite the whole Joseph story within Genesis, he steers us towards the christological significance of this much loved, and much misapplied, account of the sons of Jacob.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;During the final days with his followers, Jesus made an astonishing statement. He said, in essence, that he was the subject of all the Old Testament stories, laws, and prophecies. Following the lead of our infallible interpreter, Voddie Baucham has taken the well-worn story of Joseph and consistently drawn a portrait of our Savior through it. With its meticulous care, warm affections, and deep theological acumen, this book will introduce you to the story of Jacob&#x2019;s son, Joseph, but also to the more important story of Joseph&#x2019;s Savior, the Lord Jesus. I love the thought of using this book in a Sunday school class or for family or personal devotions. Seriously, buy it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Elyse Fitzpatrick,</strong> author, <em>Give Them Grace</em></p><p>&#x201c;You may have heard the story many times, but perhaps not quite as you will in this book. Voddie Baucham displays the brilliant colors of the gospel with uncommon richness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Horton,</strong> J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California</p><p> &#x201c;The story of Joseph is one of the most intriguing and instructive found in all the Old Testament. Deception, betrayal, deprivation, and injustice, as well as mercy, forgiveness, providence, and love are all prominently displayed in its telling. Undergirding, permeating, and guiding the events of Joseph&#x2019;s life, however, is the gospel of Jesus Christ. With careful exegesis, theological precision, and pastoral sensitivity, Baucham explains Joseph&#x2019;s story with a freshness that highlights the glorious grace of God in the gospel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas Ascol,</strong> Executive Director, Founders Ministries; Pastor, Grace Baptist Church, Cape Coral, Florida</p><p>&#x201c;Voddie&#x2019;s emphasis on redemptive history seen in the life of Joseph helps shift our eyes from a focus on Joseph and the events in his life alone to the greater reality&#x2015;the gospel on display through his life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sherrill Lanier,</strong> Women&#x2019;s Ministry Advisor for Christian Education and Publications, PCA</p></p><h2>The Secret of the Crystal Fairies (Thea Stilton: Special Edition #7): A Geronimo Stilton Adventure</h2><p>The Thea Sisters are just about to head off on their separate family vacations when they receive a call from Will Mystery.

She lives in the Cotswolds with her three children. Debbie Harter is the best selling illustrator of many Barefoot titles and is currently living in north London.PreSchool-This very simple title teaches shapes and counting. However, since the illustrations are clear and realistic and the colors are true, it could be used for color and object identification as well. Starting with a double-page spread of a building with three square windows and a door, the text asks readers to find the bear in the square. A strip on the side gives a clue as to which window is the correct one. The text on the next page asks children to find the two hearts in the queen's hair, and the right-hand strip shows the shape to search for. The book continues through 10 stars in the dark. The shapes include simple ovals and stars but also zigzags, triangles, and crescents. Specific numbers are not mentioned, but youngsters will realize that the quantities of objects are increasing. Some of the illustrations are whimsical such as moons in a cave but others are realistic with balls in a swimming pool and rectangles in a classroom. Therefore, the presentation also offers opportunities to talk about realism versus fantasy.

Are these the priests we need?</p><p> No! cries author Kevin Wells in these compelling pages that showcase how heroic priests can faithfully tread the narrow path of holy self-sacrifice first blazed by the apostles themselves. From scores of insightful interviews with modern priests, exorcists, seminary formators, and even disillusioned laity, Wells here draws forth a blueprint for priestly holiness that can once again fill our Church with priests abounding with sincere, supernatural faith, on fire with God s love, and moved by the irresistible impulse to save souls, no matter the cost to themselves.</p><p>Reading this book will deepen your own faith and help you understand what all priests, by their vocation, are consecrated and called to be.

What about a hurricane, flood, tornado, or house fire? It all starts with developing a practical disaster preparedness plan for your family. The Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness is the only book that provides step-by-step instructions for developing that plan. It emphasizes practical preparations and avoids the scare tactics of many other books.</p> <p>The 440-page handbook is a complete guide to creating a practical disaster preparedness plan. The 3rd Edition has been expanded to cover every important topic, including food storage, water purification, home improvements, electricity generation, backup heating, personal protection, financial preparations, communication systems, disaster preparedness networks, evacuations, life-saving first aid, and much more. An entire chapter is also provided for people with special needs, including the elderly, those with young children, people with disabilities, and pet owners.</p> <p>Inside the handbook are hundreds of photographs, tables, and useful tips. The new larger 8" x 10" format also includes easy-to-copy worksheets to help organize your family's preparedness plans. Working through the steps identified in this book will prepare your family for nearly any disaster, whether it be natural disasters making the news daily (e.g., earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis), or high-impact global events, such as electromagnetic pulse attacks, radiological emergencies, solar storms, or our country's impending financial collapse.</p> <p>Discover why this handbook is being praised by emergency management experts, preppers, church groups, survivalists, bloggers, soccer moms, and people from every walk of life. Now is the time to take responsibility for your family's safety by putting into place important emergency preparations.</p> <p>For more information on Dr. Bradley's books and to sign up for his free Practical Prepper Newsletter, see disasterpreparer.com.</p> <p>Also, if interested in an exciting post-apocalyptic series that follows a US Marshal after a global pandemic, check out The Survivalist (Frontier Justice).</p></p><p>Right out of the gate let me tell you what the book is NOT. It is not a book about fighting off hordes of flesh-eating zombies, should they ever rise from the grave. Nor will it describe how to survive a shipwreck by feasting on coconuts and roasted iguana. Finally, it is not intended to help you survive our planet being sucked into the cosmic fireball affectionately known as our Sun. If you wish to prepare for those types of events, I respectfully suggest that you continue your search for a more suitable text.<br><br>This&nbsp;book is designed to help your family prepare for more commonplace, yet still potentially deadly �disasters. The list is long and varied, and includes hurricanes, tornados, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, pandemics, financial collapse, widespread blackouts, and much more. My hope is that this handbook will accomplish three things: (1) motivate you to become better prepared, (2) illustrate how to prepare effectively, and (3) help you to realize your place in a larger movement.<br><br>The&nbsp;handbook&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear and easy to read&nbsp;with&nbsp;more than a hundred photos, illustrations, and worksheets. What makes this book different is that it focuses on <i>practical</i> steps that you and your family can take to become better prepared. At the beginning of each chapter, is an example scenario designed to help you consider your current level of readiness. At the end, are&nbsp;brief lists of recommended supplies.<br><br>This handbook&nbsp;will help you to&nbsp;lay out a plan&nbsp;that includes assessing your family's needs, stocking supplies, shoring up your shelter, leveraging existing resources, mitigating potential hazards, and preparing for likely threats. At the end of your efforts, you will be rewarded with knowing that your family is far better prepared to handle real world challenges.<br><br>--From the AuthorDr. Arthur Bradley holds a doctorate in engineering from Auburn University and currently works for NASA.
